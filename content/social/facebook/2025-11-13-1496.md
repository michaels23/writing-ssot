"I want to be clear at the outset here: This is disqualifying, and Jones should have dropped out. Maybe he was just joking, but that does nothing to change my opinion. Jokes like this are a diminishment to the soul. Even setting aside the moral dimension, texting something like this to a member of your opposition party betrays some truly dire political instincts. Virginians donât just deserve leaders who respect their opponentsâ inherent dignity; they deserve an attorney general smart enough to think twice before serving up a scandal this ugly on a silver platter. It isâand I choose this word carefullyâshameful. " ~Tyler Huckabee
