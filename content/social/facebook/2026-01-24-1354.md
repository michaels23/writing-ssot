Today, I asked Google Gemini about Liam Conejo Ramos.

Me: What was the name of the 5 year-old from Columbia Heights taken into ICE custody?

Gemini: 
The 5-year-old from Columbia Heights, Minnesota, who was taken into ICE custody on January 20, 2026, is **Liam Conejo Ramos**.

His detention has sparked significant national controversy due to the conflicting accounts of the incident and the methods used by federal agents.

### Key Details of the Incident

* **The "Bait" Allegation:** Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik stated that agents took Liam from a running car in his driveway and directed him to knock on the front door of his home to see if anyone else was inside, effectively using the child as "bait."
* **The DHS Response:** The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) disputed this account, claiming that Liamâs father, **Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias**, fled on foot and "abandoned" the child. DHS stated that an officer stayed with Liam for his safety until the father was apprehended.
* **Legal Status:** The family's attorney, Marc Prokosch, stated that the family has an **active asylum case** and entered the U.S. legally through a port of entry in 2024. He noted there was no deportation order against them.
* **Current Location:** As of late January 2026, Liam and his father are being held at a family residential detention facility in **Dilley, Texas**.

### Context in Columbia Heights

Liam is one of four students from the Columbia Heights Public School District reported to have been detained by immigration agents within a two-week span during a surge in enforcement. Other students detained include a 10-year-old girl and two 17-year-old boys.

Me:
If there is no deportation order against them, why did ICE detain them?

Gemini:
The detention of Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, despite having no criminal record or final deportation order, is a result of a major shift in federal immigration policy that began in early 2025.

Under current directives, ICE has moved toward a "maximize detention" and "detain until deport" strategy, which largely removes the use of prosecutorial discretion for asylum seekers. Here are the specific reasons and legal mechanisms cited for their detention:

### 1. Shift to "Mandatory" Interior Detention

In January 2025, the administration issued executive orders (such as EO 14165) and subsequent ICE memos that significantly narrowed who can be released while awaiting an asylum hearing.

* **Bond Elimination:** A July 2025 memo essentially eliminated the option of bond for many individuals who entered the U.S. without a visa, even if they later applied for asylum.
* **Mandatory Detention expansion:** Legislation like the **Laken Riley Act** (2025) and new agency directives now require ICE to start deportation casesâand prioritize detentionâfor almost anyone they arrest inside the country, regardless of humanitarian concerns or "caregiver" status.

### 2. Contested Legal Status

There is a sharp disagreement between the familyâs legal team and the federal government regarding their status:

* **The Family's Position:** Their attorney, Marc Prokosch, states they entered "the right way" through a port of entry using the **CBP One app** in 2024 and have an active, legal asylum case.
* **The Government's Position:** DHS officials, including Acting ICE Director Marcos Charles, claim the family entered the country illegally as a unit. They argue that because the father (Conejo Arias) is considered "removable" under current strict enforcement priorities, they have the authority to detain him even if a judge hasn't yet issued a final order.

### 3. Claims of "Abandonment" and Safety

DHS used a specific situational justification for why 5-year-old Liam was taken into custody rather than left with family:

* **The "Abandonment" Argument:** ICE officials claim that when they approached the father, he fled on foot, leaving Liam alone in a running car. They argue they took the child into custody for his own safety in "frigid temperatures."
* **Refusal of Local Care:** ICE claims that when they brought Liam to his front door, his mother (who was inside) refused to open the door and take him. Neighbors and school officials vehemently dispute this, stating they offered to take the child but were ignored by agents.
* **Parental Request:** ICE maintains that the father eventually requested that Liam remain with him in the family detention center in Dilley, Texas, rather than being placed in the care of social services or other relatives.

### 4. Administrative vs. Judicial Warrants

This case highlights a recent memo (May 2025) that authorizes ICE officers to use **administrative warrants** more aggressively. Unlike judicial warrants signed by a judge, these are internal ICE documents. The administration argues these warrants are sufficient to arrest individuals they deem removable, even if the person is currently in the middle of a multi-year asylum process.

Me:
Do we know if the family actually did enter using CBP One app in 2024 and have an active, legal asylum case?

Gemini:
Based on the public reports and statements from the family's legal counsel, here is what is known regarding their entry and legal status:

### The Claim of Entry via CBP One

The familyâs attorney, Marc Prokosch, has explicitly stated that the family **did enter the United States via a port of entry using the CBP One app in 2024.** * **Legal Significance:** Using the CBP One app is the federally sanctioned process for asylum seekers to schedule an appointment and present themselves legally to border officials. If this is verified, it contradicts DHSâs public claims that the family "entered the country illegally."

* **Documentation:** Prokosch has indicated that he possesses the documentation proving their legal entry and their subsequent registration in the immigration system.

### Active Asylum Case Status

According to the family's legal representation, they have an **active, pending asylum case.**

* Under U.S. law, individuals who have been processed at a port of entry and have a pending asylum claim are generally considered to be in a "period of authorized stay" while they await their court dates.
* The attorney noted that the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, had been complying with all previous check-ins and court requirements prior to his arrest in January 2026.

### Why the Discrepancy Exists?

The conflict between the family's claims and the DHS narrative typically stems from two factors:

1. **Definitions of "Legal":** While the family argues they followed the legal *process* for asylum, the current administration has taken a stricter stance, often labeling anyone who does not arrive with a pre-approved visa as "removable," regardless of whether they used the CBP One app.
2. **The New Enforcement Policy:** Under the "maximize detention" policy enacted in early 2025, ICE has been instructed to detain individuals with pending cases if they are deemed a "priority," a category that has been broad enough to include many who were previously allowed to remain free while awaiting their hearings.

While the government continues to refer to them as "removable," the available evidence from their legal representative points to a family that was following the established legal protocols for seeking asylum until the moment of their detention.

Me:
Is there any evidence to support Zena Stenvik's statement that agents took Liam from a running car in his driveway and directed him to knock on the front door of his home to see if anyone else was inside?

Gemini:
Evidence supporting Superintendent Zena Stenvik's statement comes from several sources who were present at the scene, though the details remain a point of intense dispute between local officials and the federal government.

### Evidence and Witness Accounts

* **Direct Witnesses:** Mary Granlund, the chair of the Columbia Heights Public Schools Board, stated she witnessed the encounter while picking up her own children. She corroborated that there was a "fluid situation" where she and other adults offered to take custody of Liam, but were refused by agents.
* **Photographic Evidence:** Two photographs of the encounter were released by school officials:
* One image shows Liam, wearing a blue knit hat and a Spider-Man backpack, standing at his front door with a masked agent by his side.
* Another photo shows Liam standing by a vehicle with an agent holding onto his backpack.

* **Audio/Video Evidence:** A video recorded by a neighbor and posted to social media (notably Reddit) captured the scene in the driveway. While it primarily features community members blowing whistles and yelling at agents, it confirms the presence of the "still-running vehicle" and the proximity of agents to the child.
* **Corroborating Statements:** Stenvik maintains that she visited the home shortly after the incident and spoke with the mother and other adults living in the home who "begged" agents to let them care for the child.

### The "Bait" Allegation vs. DHS Account

Stenvikâs specific claimâthat agents directed Liam to knock on the door to see if others were insideâis the core of the "bait" allegation.

| Source | Perspective on the "Knock" |
| --- | --- |
| **School Officials** | Assert agents used Liam to lure the mother/others out of the house because they lacked a judicial warrant to enter. |
| **DHS/ICE** | Term the "bait" description an "abject lie." They claim an officer stayed with Liam only for his safety because the father "fled on foot" and "abandoned" him. |
| **DHS Statement** | Asserts that agents *tried* to get the mother to take the child, but she refused to open the door. |

While the photographs confirm that a masked agent led Liam to the front door, the **intent** behind that action (whether it was a safety check or a tactical "bait" maneuver) remains the primary point of contention.

Me:
Is there any evidence to support DHS's claim that Liamâs father fled on foot and "abandoned" the child?

Gemini:
The claim that Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias fled and "abandoned" his son is the official position of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), but it is heavily disputed by multiple eyewitnesses and local officials.

The available information regarding this claim is summarized below:

### 1. The DHS / Federal Government Position

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin and Vice President JD Vance have both asserted that the father attempted to evade arrest.

* **The "Fleeing" Claim:** DHS states that as agents approached the vehicle in the driveway, the father fled on foot, leaving the 5-year-old alone in the running car.
* **The "Safety" Justification:** Federal officials argue that an agent stayed with Liam solely to ensure his safety in "frigid temperatures" while other officers pursued and apprehended his father.
* **The "Abandonment" Label:** DHS has used the term "abandoned" in social media posts and press statements to characterize the fatherâs alleged actions.

### 2. Contradicting Eyewitness Accounts

Several people who were at the scene or arrived shortly after have challenged the government's narrative:

* **No Evidence of Flight:** Columbia Heights City Council Member Rachel James, who lives in the neighborhood, stated that when she pulled up, the father was already "standing very still and calmly" next to his vehicle with agents around him. She saw no evidence of a struggle or a chase.
* **School Board Observation:** School Board Chair Mary Granlund, who was also on the scene, stated that agents had "ample opportunity" to hand the child over to other adultsâincluding another adult resident of the home who was outsideâbut refused to do so.
* **Dispute of the "Abandonment" Narrative:** Witnesses and school officials maintain that the father did not abandon Liam. Instead, some accounts suggest he may have moved toward the house specifically to alert his wife not to open the door to the masked agents, whom they say lacked a judicial warrant.

### 3. Visual and Physical Evidence

* **Running Vehicle:** Both sides agree the car was left running in the driveway. While DHS cites this as proof of a hasty flight, school officials use it to highlight how suddenly the family was intercepted after arriving home from preschool.
* **Photographs:** Images from the scene show Liam standing by the front door with a masked agent. While these confirm the child was in ICE custody at the door, they do not provide visual proof of the preceding moments regarding the father's alleged flight.

In summary, there is **no publicly available video or photographic evidence** confirming the father fled. The "fleeing" and "abandonment" claims rely entirely on the statements of the arresting DHS/ICE agents, which are directly contradicted by the observations of local city and school leaders who were present.
