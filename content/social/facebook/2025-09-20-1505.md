I witnessed an assault yesterday afternoon. I called 911 to report it. It's reassuring that the operator's first questions were all about the victim.

When I told the operator the perpetrator was still close by, I think the ensuing dialog was almost verbatim:

Operator: "What race is he?"

Me: "Um ... err ... ah ... I'm not comfortable answering that."

Operator: "Is he black, white, Hispanic ... you know?"

Me: "Well ... ... ... he has brown skin."

Operator: "How tall is he?"

Me: "About 6 foot"

Operator: "What's his build? Thin? Trim? Medium? Heavy-set?"

Me: "Pretty trim"

Operator: "What color clothes is he wearing?"

Me: "Powder blue tee shirt and turquoise shorts."

Operator: "Thanks; now, just so the officers don't get confused, what color clothes are you wearing?"
