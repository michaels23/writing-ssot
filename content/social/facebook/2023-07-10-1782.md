Lots of encouraging news here I wouldn't have thought of on my own. I especially like how Deepak paraphrases my career objective: "By taking over meaningless routine work, AI creates a space for more meaningful activity. Forced work that has no meaning is a major way we lose our humanity in everyday life."
