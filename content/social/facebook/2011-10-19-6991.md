Jesus told us to pray, âSave us from the time of trialâ (a far better translation than âLead us not into temptationâ), because the trial could make it difficult to pray at all. A good-times faith is one thing, but in the wilderness, faith needs to go deep.

-- Tom Ehrich, On a Journey (Morning Walk Media)
