This morning, I 'rescued' a neighbor who had locked her keys in her car.

Moments ago, I discovered I had lost 48 minutes and a cup of detergent washing ... you guessed it ... an empty machine (not the basket of laundry I still see next to the machine).

Clearly, whatever karma is, it does not operate the way I think it does.
