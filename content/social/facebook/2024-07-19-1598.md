"Our âCall to Civic Discipleshipâ lists among its commitments that Christians in politics should exhibit the fruit of the Spirit â love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23) â as well as seeking truth, being firm but civil, being principled but not ideological, confronting violence with nonviolence, and more." ~ Adam Russell Taylor
