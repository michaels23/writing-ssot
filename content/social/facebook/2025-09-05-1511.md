"But what is your best self, and how do you realize it? This hasnât been easy to define, and many people are confused. If you aim to succeed in your career, for example, how is that balanced with other, higher values like loving kindness, being fair to everyone equally, attending to your family, and not resisting others as a way of pushing your agenda forward? Success, as we all know, sometimes goes to people who are ruthlessly competitive, selfish, and unfair. Where does your best self come in, through surrender, acceptance, and moral behavior, even if this means getting run over and taken advantage of?" ~ @[100044282026822:2048:Deepak Chopra]
