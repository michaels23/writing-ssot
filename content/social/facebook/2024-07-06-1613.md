I am fond of the Propaganda game (the actual game: https://gamesforthinkers.org/all/social-studies/the-propaganda-game, not the movie). It has taught me more about critical thinking than any academic or professional experience. As I gain experience (get older?) I perceive greater value in critical thinking that I do in knowledge. Wow, I never thought that could happen.
