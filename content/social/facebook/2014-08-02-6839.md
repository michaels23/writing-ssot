I've been asked (more than once) what I hope to accomplish with (some) of my Facebook posts. When I remember to actually ask myself that question (before merely tapping the 'Like' or 'Share' button) I strive to disseminate unbiased facts, and trust everyone to decide the truth for themselves. I can't pretend to live up to that 100%, but that's the goal.
