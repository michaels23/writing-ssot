A few months ago, you came within one game of joining the exclusive club of Michigan alum who have been alive for a national championship in football, basketball, hockey, and baseball. For now, you'll just have to settle for being an alum of the only school that has EVER claimed all four.

By the way, HAPPY BIRTHDAY
