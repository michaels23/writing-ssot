"Evil thrives in the dark. First order of business when evil takes charge is to crush the light, demonize the agents of light, extol the corridors of darkness, declare some work too important to be known, some leaders too valuable to be accessible or held accountable. First attack on democracy in America will be on freedom of speech.

 It was telling, therefore, that on their first day in session, the new Congress voted to gut the ethics office whose work is to hold them accountable, and to ban the live-streaming of Congress at work."
