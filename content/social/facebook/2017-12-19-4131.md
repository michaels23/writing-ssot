"Mary was perplexed. She knew she didnât belong in this story. She wasnât a person of stature. In the standards of that era, she was nothing, merely a girl, old enough to marry and to bear children, but otherwise of no significance. Why was an angel greeting her in this lavish way? Even when the angel explained himself, she remained perplexed. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
