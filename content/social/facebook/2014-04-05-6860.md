I discovered today that $^!+ Creek is not just a metaphor. It runs through my (dog's) back yard. I wrote down the recipe in case you want to make your own:

Ingredients:
1. 75 lbs. Golden Retriever
2. 1 Winter (harsh)
3. 12 inches snow (dense, if possible)
4. 1 Back Yard (sloped, if possible)

Instructions:
1. Set Golden Retriever in Winter for at least six months. Try to clean up after him according to how much $^!+ you want in your Creek.
2. Dump snow on back yard over 16 hour period.
3. Bake ingredients at 55F or higher for 12 hours.
4. Pray for paddle.
