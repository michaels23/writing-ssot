A lawyer and farmer had a head-on car collision on a country road. Neither one of them was badly hurt, but both men were shaken. So the farmer went to his car, got a flask, and offered it to the lawyer. He said, "Here, you look like you need a drink." The lawyer took a couple of swigs, and at the farmer's urging he took a few more. 

Afterwards, the lawyer handed the flask to the farmer and said, "Your turn." 

"No thanks," said the farmer. "I'm waiting for the sheriff."
