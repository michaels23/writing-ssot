"Consider the fate of John 3.1-17. Words that Jesus intended as hopeful have been weaponized into two of Christianityâs most heinous forms of bullying. One is the âborn-againâ cohort who claim absolute superiority because they can demonstrate being born again, perhaps through charismatic renewal. The other is the use of John 3.16 as a weapon against all other forms of faith." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
