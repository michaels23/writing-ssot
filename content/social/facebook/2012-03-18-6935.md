is switching between the Ohio/USF and Lehigh/Xavier games trying to come up with a reason to care who wins. I don't have any of them in my brackets and I don't think I have any ties to any of those four schools. Unless some of my friends went to one of them, I may just have to watch because I like basketball. :-0
