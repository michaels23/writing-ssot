If I substitute 'God' or 'spirit' for 'consciousness' in this article, my theological and scientific training get along much better. For example:

Until we all are willing to think fresh thoughts about a worn-out question, *God* will remain constricted. If *spirit* begins to expand on an individual basis, there is hope for clarity. More importantly, we can begin to bring centuries of baseless fear and superstition to an end. Iâd suggest that ending the superstition of materialism would be a good start.
