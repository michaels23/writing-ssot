"When Jesus called his people to welcome prophets, he wasnât sketching out a nice fellowship of friendly souls. Jesus wasnât founding a church. He wasnât anointing its leaders. He was extolling the truth and those who are brave enough to speak it. He knew that proclaiming the truth would kill him, and he knew that speaking the truth would kill them. Prophets are never welcome. But if the truth is to set Godâs people free, someone must speak it. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
