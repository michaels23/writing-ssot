"We are a species of consciousness whose great pitfall isnât evil but âmind-forgâd manacles,â to borrow a phrase from the poet William Blake. We make up mental constructs, invent stories around them, and tell the next generation that these stories are true. One story says that women are inferior, a complex tale that gave rise to a thousand injustices and false beliefs. Us-versus-them thinking leads to stories about racism and nationalism that cause their barbarous results." ~ @[100044282026822:2048:Deepak Chopra]
