Moderate turbulence on this flight. Used to scare me almost to death, but perhaps I've come to grips with it. I guess it was more than another passenger could handle, though. As the attendant removed the air sickness back from the seat pocket in front of me, "I need to borrow this." 

Borrow? 

I hope she understands I don't want it back.
