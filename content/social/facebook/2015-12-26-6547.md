Dear ESPN announcers and producers,

Are there words I can use to convince you that I promise to watch the New Year's Six? In the meantime, please, pretty please, keep me informed about the GAME I AM ACTUALLY TRYING TO WATCH RIGHT NOW. 

For example, I'm curious to know why that last play was pass interference and why it was a 15 yard penalty as opposed to a spot foul? Occluding my view with graphics and talking about what MSU must do to beat Alabama won't really interest me for ... oh ... about five more days.

Deal?
