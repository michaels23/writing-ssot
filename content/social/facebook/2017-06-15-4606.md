"Jesus warned them, however, that doing good would stir evil into action. Being a child of God would provoke the darkness. The principalities and powers wouldn't be content to close their ears against God's word. They would attack the speakers of that word and demand silence, even death. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
