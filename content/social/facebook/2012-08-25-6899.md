"Many people spend a great deal of time complaining about the government, 
their parents, and the sorry state of affairs in the world, but in doing 
so they forget that we are the miracle. They blame God for the suffering 
that surrounds us saying, 'How could a loving God allow such things to 
happen?' They behave like slaves who blame an overseer, forgetting that 
free will has given them the responsibility, so that the deeper issue has 
nothing do with God or the government but rather with the fundamental 
shift that must occur in the human heart if peace is to become a reality. 
We think of responsibility as a burdensome obligation when in fact it is a 
gift." 
âDarren John Main
