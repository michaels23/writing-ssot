[Thus the idler who inherits great wealth but then berates the poor for not working hard enough. Thus the beneficiary of âsocialism for the richâ who wails about the âsafety netâ when it rescues another. They were happy to receive without working, but ingratitude took over. ] ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
