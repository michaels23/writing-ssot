I subscribe to Tom Ehrich 's Daily Meditation. I identify so closely, almost daily, with each email, it's almost like I've been brainwashed. (Of course, if I was brainwashed, I'd be the last to know.)

I'll share this excerpt from today's email, which hit so close, my jaw dropped:

"I am, you see, a patriot. I am a patriot in one of the many senses of that word. I donât share a single idea with the right-wing and only some ideas with my fellow progressives. But I love my country â as they do â and I want the best for America. "
