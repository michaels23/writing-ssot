"Christians have fallen short in many ways. Worrying too much about  the quantity of water at baptism, for example, as well as a theory about the bread in eucharist. Wanting too much to have the kingâs ear, even if the king was an evil man and allying with him corrupted the church. It was a grievous sin when Christians allowed their political and cultural values to make them apologists for slavery, racism, apartheid, and anti-Semitism. Itâs one thing to have racist views. Itâs quite another to claim that Jesus shares those racist views and doesnât care about who gets hurt. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
