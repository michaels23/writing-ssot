As p!$$=( as am at all the arctic snow, I gratefully agree with this observation: "I keep thinking about our Minnesota plow drivers over the past weeks. Theyâve done an incredible job keeping us moving during the snowiest February and 4th snowiest month of all time in the Twin Cities and much of Minnesota. I hope theyâre getting enough sleep. Give your local plow crew a hug or buy them a beer when you see them."
