"On a day when the powerful were plotting to amass more power, the wealthy scheming to gain more wealth, those who cannot accept strangers or allow them freedom were denying basic human and civil rights, and the ugly politics of bigotry, disdain for the needy and serving the wealthy were corroding even our most august institutions -- on a day when passers-by scorned God and carried a golden calf of their own design, two dozen singers formed a circle, allowed every knee to bend in its own way and every tongue to confess in its own language, and lifted it all up to God."

"Whether or not God has a plan, whether or not our appeals change the mind of God, whether or not the language of prayer should be subversive or sedate, exuberant or calm, the circle forms, God is here, and all God's people sing "Amen!"
