"For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; onl not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgenc but through love become slaves to one another. For the w law is summed up in a single commandment, âYou shall lo your neighbor as yourself.â If, however, you bite and devou one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another." 

-Galatians 5:13-15
