âEvery year we waste enough,
To feed the ones who starve.
We build our civilization up,
And we shoot it down with wars..

O it's Jesus Christ our president,
God above our king. With a job and a pension for young and old,
We will make hallelujah ringâ

- Woody Guthrie, from "Christ for President"
