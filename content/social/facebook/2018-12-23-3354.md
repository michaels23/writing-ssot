Sally's stroke re-awakened me to the scary reality that our time with loved ones is limited. This finite, earthly lifetime just doesn't have enough space for to be with so many that I want to be present for. What a mixed blessing! So glad I got to spend some more time with someone I so dearly love. Wishing I could find more ways to spend more time with so many loved ones.
