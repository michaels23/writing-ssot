American patriotism is always prepared for a fight. We have such a fight on our hands. This is another time when those who truly love all that America stands for cannot take the easy course of being âsummer soldiers and sunshine patriots.â (Paine) Americaâs noble experiment in self-determination cannot be allowed to âperish from the earth.â (Lincoln) ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
