"Therefore, it is up to us as citizens to play the role of leadership that has been abandoned in Washington. In Nachmanâs parable, it is noted that the king and the minister are also friends. We also must become friends who remind each other of what is real. We have to show each other the marks on our foreheads because sometimes we need support to stay sane." ~ Rodger Kamenetz http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/spiritual-practice-in-the-time-of-the-mad-king
