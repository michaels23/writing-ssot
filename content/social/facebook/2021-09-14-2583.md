I really want to learn how to avoid this: 

"It might seem impossible to think that any three questions canâand shouldâbe asked any time that things go wrong, but the sad truth is that millions of us dwell on the three questions we *shouldnât* ask, questions such as: 
1. What's wrong with me? 
2. Who can I blame? 
3. What's the worst-case scenario?" 
~Deepak Chopra
