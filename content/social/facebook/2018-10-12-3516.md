"In time, as Jesus said, âmany who are first will be last, and the last will be first.â The moral narrative matters. Itâs unlikely America will see a Marxist revolution. More likely, the moneyed set will find its myth unmasked, its privileges mocked, its supposed excellence dismissed, and its government benefactors voted out." ~Tom Ehrich
