âHardness of heartâ infuriated Jesus. It was a decision for self and against the other. It ignored Godâs fundamental call to love our neighbor. It set out to be deliberately cruel, to hurt someone else just for the satisfaction of hurting. It was like the leader who delights in belittling his staff. ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
