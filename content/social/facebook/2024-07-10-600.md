"Understanding obesity as simply calories in, calories out is not useful at all because it doesnât try to understand WHY calories in> calories out â ie. ultra processed foods, food addictions, mindless eating, depression, poor habits, lack of eating schedules. If people are addicted to food, and therefore calories in> calories out, then we need to treat the addiction, not just tell people to âeat fewer caloriesâ. Itâs 100% not useful."
