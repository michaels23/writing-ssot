"Jesus knows that the Son of Man in the vision of Daniel is seen to be a messiah and a military one at that, but rather than invest that vision with any reality that would fortify that understanding, he chooses instead to align himself with a more Isaian image, that of the suffering servant, the one who endures the rejection and revulsion of people in obedience to the will of God. Trusting in God's strength and history to save him, he throws his lot in with the history of his nation, whatever the outcome may be for his personal safety." ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
