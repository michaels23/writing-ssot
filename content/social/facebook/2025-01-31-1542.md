"My favorite metaphor in scripture compares the health of the church to that of the human body with many parts, as the Apostle Paul writes, âJust as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christâ (1 Corinthians 12:12). Though written about the church, I think this text applies equally to our country and the world. Weâre interdependent, all with different roles to play as we fulfill the biblical injunction to protect people who are threatened by policies that will dismantle our refugee and asylum system, break families apart, eviscerate programs that provide a lifeline to struggling families, reverse progress in addressing the climate crisis, and so much more. Our roles wonât be the same all the time, and thatâs okay; thatâs the point. " ~ Adam Russell Taylor
