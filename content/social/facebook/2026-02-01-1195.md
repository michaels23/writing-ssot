I think I am now experiencing grief for the first time in my life. I've experienced regret before. I've experienced sadness before. I'm now plumbing new depths.
I've lost my share of loved ones. I've lost my share of pets. I'm sad this world lost Renee Good, although I never knew her. I'm sad this world lost Alex Pretti, although I never knew him. I don't think I *grieve* any of those losses.
I think what I grieve is the cruelty. I hope I'm wrong, but my perception is that the killers enjoyed it.
