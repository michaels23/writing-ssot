"Law enforcement personnel train for everything they do. I try to imagine a class where the scenario was: a parent arrives illegally with a child in tow, now seize the child to terrorize the parent. Pile children into detention camps to dehumanize them. Publicize actions like snatching a nursing baby from its motherâs breast. Make entering America to seek asylum seem so horrible that no one will want to try it."
