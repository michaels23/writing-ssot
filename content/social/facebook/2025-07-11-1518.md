"But according to a small but noisy group of liberals and leftists, thereâs a cruel logic to this tragedy that appears to run thus: Texas is a red state and therefore has thrown its electoral weight behind the Trump administrationâs DOGE cuts, which have devastated both the National Weather Service and various science programs designed to study and combat the impacts of climate change. Add a general conservative dismissiveness of government help â even if that help is as straightforward as extreme weather warnings â and there is a small but pervasive idea among some liberals and leftists that Texas brought this on itself. " ~Tyler Huckabee
