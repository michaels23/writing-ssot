I've been ramming things with golf carts for decades. I hope NASA gets better results that I have.

"The golf-cart-size spacecraft will travel to an asteroid that's more than 6 million miles away â and poses no danger to Earth â and ram into it. Scientists will then watch to see how the asteroid's trajectory changes."
