The rector's welcome from St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Marco Island, Fl ...

We extend a special welcome to those who are single, married, divorced, gay, bisexual, transgender, straight, filthy rich, or dirt poor. We extend a special welcome to those who are crying newborns, skinny as a rake or could afford to lose a few pounds.

We welcome you if you can sing like Pavarotti or are like our Rector (who canât carry a tune in a bucket). Youâre welcome here if youâre âjust browsing,â just woke up or just got out of prison. We donât care if you are more Christian than the Archbishop of Canterbury, or havenât been in church since _________âs baptism.

We extend a special welcome to those who are over 60 but not grown up yet, and to teenagers who are growing up too fast. We welcome keep-fit moms, football dads, starving artists, tree-huggers, latte-sippers, vegetarians, junk-food eaters. We welcome those who are in recovery or still addicted. We welcome you if youâre having problems or youâre down in the dumps or if you donât like âorganized religion,â weâve been there too!

If you blew all your money on the horses, youâre welcome here. We offer a welcome to those who think the world is flat, work too hard, donât work, canât spell, or because your family is in town and wanted to go to church. We welcome you to a place where you donât have to be afraid.

We welcome those who are inked, pierced or both. We offer a special welcome to those who could use a prayer right now, had religion shoved down your throat as a kid or got lost coming over the bridge and wound up here by mistake. We welcome tourists, seekers and doubters, bleeding hearts â¦ and you, because we are all children of one Father.
