"As the Torah makes clear, from the standpoint of the Jewish god YHVH, no one has a RIGHT to any part of the earthâso it hears God as saying kee kol haâaretz (âthe whole earth belongs to MEâ) as YHVHâs response to those who refuse to share it and redistribute its produce every seven years in the Sabbatical year and every 50 years in a fundamental redistribution of all wealth in the Jubilee (Yovel)." @[100063749041885:2048:Tikkun - An Interfaith Magazine]
