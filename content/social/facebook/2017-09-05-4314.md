[âTaking up the crossâ is being aware of the cost of choosing to live in the reign of God. Living with Abba as oneâs sole ruler will bring one into conflict with whatever powers claim that obeisance of us here, and will inevitably, in some way, if we are truly aware and faithful to the gospel, lead us to the real cross. Itâs a kind of witness to how few people really live the gospel, and how many of them arenât actually Catholic, that so few of us are killed. ] ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
