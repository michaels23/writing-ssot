"system teaches people to blame themselves, tells them that they live in a meritocracy in which those who own 80 percent of the wealth of the planet do so because they deserve to, while all the rest of us, the 90 percent without economic security, are thus situated because we werenât smart enough, made bad choices, didnât work hard enough or otherwise screwed up our own lives." ~Rabbi Michael Lerner
