[This is the way America is supposed to work. Basic civility and generous humanity keep the doors open to new arrivals. This country was built by new arrivals seeking freedom and opportunity and by restless old arrivals seeking new ground. The forces of repression are old arrivals who want to pull up the drawbridge that they themselves walked across and deny access to the new. They call themselves âpatriotic Americans,â but they are really just selfish and fearful. ] ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
