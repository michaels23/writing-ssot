"This, in my opinion, is the drama of the Resurrection. In this week, it is common for all eyes to turn to Jesus and what he endured. We should spend at least as much time looking at the crowd that killed him -- tongues run amok, control needs overwhelming kindness, hubris denying anything new and different, self-serving gone wild. Jesus was killed by people like us and under the conditions that often prevail among us. We might not drive nails into hands, but we haven't hesitated to kill our communities of faith." ~Tom Ehrich
