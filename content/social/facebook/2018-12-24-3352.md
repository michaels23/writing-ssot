"Christians have romanticized this birth story so thoroughly that we must strain to remember its reality. Jesus was born to oppressed people. The setting was filthy. Joseph probably cut the umbilical cord himself, using whatever knife he carried. I picture the helpless baby lying on Maryâs skin, his heart pumping fast, his lungs working hard, his mouth and hands reaching for food." ~Tom Ehrich
