"Jesus said that, when adversity comes in the form of a great tribulation, we should âstand up and raise (our) heads.â Rather than whine about discomfort, we should face the storm. Rather than blame someone for making our lives difficult, we should embrace the difficulty. Rather than guard our emergency supplies, we should share them." ~Tom Ehrich
