"See, in the same 24 hour news cycle that only can speak of evil â babies were born

and people feel in love

and someone put an old ladyâs shopping cart back for her

and casseroles were brought to the home-bound

and prayers were said

and little girls made brand new friends

and someone paid for the coffee of the person behind them in line

and flowers were brought to the Dallas police department

and children made perfectly misspelled protest signs

and people made up

and someone in the coffee shop let me hold their baby because they could tell I needed it

and when pastor Reaganâs car broke down in the middle of nowhere during his vacation, someone came along at just the right moment and towed it 126 miles all the way to Denver.

and Every second of every day our God arrives unannounced in the merciful and loving kindness of other people and in the midst of single acts of evil I want to be a warrior of that. " ~Nadia Bolz-Weber
