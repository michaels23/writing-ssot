A dear friend in Michigan asked yesterday what she could to do to help us. It was quite a challenge to imagine anything she wasn't already doing. Indeed, my first few suggestions were actions she had already taken. About 30 minutes after I realized wracking my brain rarely achieves the desired results, this image appeared in my feed. About twelve hours later, it now dawns on me, "She might not be the only one of my friends that wants to help besieged Minnesotans ..."
