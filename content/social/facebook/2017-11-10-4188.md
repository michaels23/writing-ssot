Christians have wanted to say Yes. We want God to be made in our image. We want God to be as harsh and unforgiving as we are. Even though Jesus taught that our forgiveness must be infinite, and that nothing a wayward son could do would trash the love of his father, we prefer stories of limits, sins that cannot be forgiven, behaviors that push a person beyond Godâs reach. One purpose of the doctrines we formulate is to define those boundaries. We simply donât want God to be merciful, except possibly to us.  ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
