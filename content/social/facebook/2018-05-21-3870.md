"Yes, many of them vote the conservative line. But I donât hear the racism, resentments, greed and anti-immigrant nationalism that supposedly feeds conservative preferences. They just donât trust Washington and big government. They see through the Republican tax heist of 2017. They have little but scorn for the liar and bully now occupying the White House. They just donât think Democrats have anything better to offer, and they hear the patronizing attitudes. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
