As a citizen of a constitutional democracy grounded in free speech and free assembly, I can speak my mind about President Trump and not face immediate danger. I hope it never comes to facing danger. But I am not naive about Trumpâs desperate and autocratic state of mind. He could undo our freedoms, and then free-speakers like myself could be in danger.  ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
