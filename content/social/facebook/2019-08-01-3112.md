Thirty-two-year-old Gregory Allan Wilson of St. Peter was sentenced for gross misdemeanor child neglect Tuesday. Wilson pleaded guilty in May, and additional charges of domestic assault and malicious punishment of a child were dismissed.

Wilson's girlfriend, 43-year-old Lynda Ruth Michel, pleaded guilty Tuesday to gross misdemeanor child neglect. She will be sentenced in October.
