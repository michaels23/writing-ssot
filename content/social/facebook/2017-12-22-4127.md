"A Christian movement made up of people like Mary would transform the world, redeem lost humanity, bring to pass the new creation that God desires. As it is, we make promises we donât intend to keep, surround ourselves with comforts, and seek the favor of all. I see Mary as tough. I wish we Christians could be as tough." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
