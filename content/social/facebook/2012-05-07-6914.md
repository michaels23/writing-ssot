Authenticity
"It is better to be disliked for who you are than to be liked for who you
are not. How much easier to be authentic than to pretend to be someone you
are not. What a relief just to be. How clear and simple. How honest. How
real. The only thing you really have to share with anyone, anyway, is your
own state of being."
~Judith Ann Parsons
