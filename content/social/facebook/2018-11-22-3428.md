"Jesus devoted two-thirds of his teaching to wealth and power. He didnât offer a guidebook on how to gain power, how to wield power, or how to preserve power. He taught how to give it away, not as a strategy for rising victorious, but as a reality from Godâs realm. Wealth and power have no life. Only God can give life. Only God can shine light in the darkness. Only God can fill the empty places that terrify us." ~Tom Ehrich
