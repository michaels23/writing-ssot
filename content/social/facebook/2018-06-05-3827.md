A common theme of American life has been targeting the odd â witches, immigrants, intellectuals, Jews, former slaves, uppity women â and seeking retribution. Other nations have done the same. If someone is saying things we donât want to hear, he must be âout of his mind,â a tool of the devil, a danger to society.
