"How could a slave forgiven of his debt turn around and refuse mercy to someone who owed him money? How could the beneficiaries of, say, government protection of their property turn around and deny protection to others? How could a bank that received massive forgiveness of bad decisions turn around and hold a forlorn over-burdened debtor rigorously responsible? " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
