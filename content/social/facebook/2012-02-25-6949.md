suggests the RNC choose the candidate that wins a talent contest. Each must sing this special verse of God Bless America (apologies to Irving Berlin) without tele-prompter or footnotes:

God bless America, land of small gov.
Stand beside her(1) and guide her(2) 
to the right with the light from Karl Rove.
Blast the mountains.
Screw the fairies.
Drill the oceans, Gulf and Nome.
God bless America, like ancient Rome(3).
God bless America, my home, sweet home(4).

(1) but not if she wants to marry another woman
(2) or wants to use birth control
(3) after it became a Christian Nation, of course
(4) until a bailed-out bank forecloses

The candidate making the fewest gaffes wins. In case of a tie, count the # of delegates that shout "Let them die!" after the "Screw the fairies" verse.
