Apparently, ear worms do not require a melody. For the rest of the day, I expect to hum, "This will serve as the the final and immediate boarding call for Spirit flight 918 to New Orleans. All passengers must make their way to gate D11 so that we can have an on-time departure."

Catchy rhythm, but I don't think kids can dance to it, Dick.
