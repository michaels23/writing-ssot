There are two kinds of success.One is the very rare kind that comes to the person who has the power to do what no one else has the power to do.That is genius.But the average person who wins what we call success is not a genius.That person is a man or woman who has merely the ordinary qualities that they share with their fellows,but who has developed those ordinary qualities to a more than ordinary degree.
