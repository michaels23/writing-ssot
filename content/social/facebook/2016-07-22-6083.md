"The rest of yesterdayâs gospel makes sense to me: I can believe, want to believe more strongly, in a God who loves me more than the loving fathers and mothers that I have known in my life, because Iâve known some really heroic ones. I can pray the Lordâs prayer with hope. I need to be forgiven, so I struggle to forgive, releasing those debts, real and imagined, that other people owe me. " ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
