"Yesterday's health care vote could have been about health care. Instead, it was a deliberate and small-minded assault on the weak, the poor and the elderly. We know that because the Party of Cruelty lied, hid, rushed and schemed to prevent anyone from seeing its actions clearly. And when our president, who epitomizes the delight of cruelty, declared victory, the point was getting his swagger back, not doing anything to help the American people.
