"The point of Maryâs parentage, it seems to me, is that God chose a nobody to bear the Son. In this context, âvirginâ probably meant âyoung woman not yet married.â Jesus didnât have royal lineage or a larger-than-life upbringing. Mary said Yes to Gabriel, and Jesus said Yes to God, and the disciples said Yes to Jesus. That saying of Yes was the heart of the incarnation. Not arguments about virginity and human vs. divine and order of being called, but obedience, willingness, embracing something other than self-interest." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
