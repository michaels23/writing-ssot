[I needed the Third Commandment, the one Jesus gave many times, not just in response to a lawyerâs crafty question. âDo not be afraid,â Jesus said. Do not be afraid of those who oppose you. Do not be afraid to sacrifice and suffer. Do not be afraid to live for others in a world trapped in self-serving. Do not be afraid to embrace change, for God is âdoing a new thing.â Do not be afraid to give away your wealth, for God will provide. Do not be afraid to love the outcast and least.] ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
