"It occurs to me that as I begin Lent, the disciplines of fasting, prayer, and almsgiving are ways of changing my habits of self-preservation and aggrandizement into habits of other-centeredness, whether that other be God (in prayer) or neighbor (in almsgiving), for these are the same, according to the gospel. Fasting is another way of giving myself away, of not clinging to habits of self-preservation as a higher good than self gift. Of course, all of these things can be crazy, too, they have to be done with the right attitude (see Ash Wednesdayâs gospel) and with an attitude like that of Christ, which upholds the value of life as manifestation of divine being. All fasting, almsgiving, and prayer is governed by the law of love, including the healthy love of oneself, appreciating oneâs existence as a divine gift. Fasting will help me not to ask for stones to be turned to bread. Prayer will help me to remember who loves me, who is with me, who calls me, and not to worship lesser gods. Almsgiving will help me not cling to what I possess as my savior, and teach me better to trust my baptismal connection to other people, and not miraculous divine intervention, as the salvation of the world." @[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
