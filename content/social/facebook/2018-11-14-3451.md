"Perhaps now we can hear Jesusâ warning: âMany will come in my name and say, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray.â For that is what has been happening. Just as Christians turned Europe into a bloody field where serfs died and prelates processed grandly, so have Christians in America operated behind closed doors to celebrate themselves and ignore a needy world." ~Tom Ehrich
