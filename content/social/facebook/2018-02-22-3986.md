"The marketplace and political system are saved by their constituents, not by their leading entities. It is customers who push a Facebook to get real. It is teenagers in Parkland, FL, who are doing what politicians on their own wonât do. It is women who, in just a few months, shredded a male-power system in Hollywood and elsewhere. It is citizens in the streets and balloting who will push back when Trump goes too far, like trying to fire Mueller or to end freedom of the press. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
