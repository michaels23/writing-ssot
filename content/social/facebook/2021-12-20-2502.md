... as we forgive those who trespass ... against OUR lane, WITHOUT signaling, BARELY missing our right fenders and THEN slowing down ... *

... lead us not into temptation (because I'm aiming my imaginary phaser at their tires and the bumper sticker I disagree with), but deliver us from ... 

... ego.

* (I left out the part about forgive me for trespassing into someone else's lane the other day.)
