I am on my own, individualized path through life, I am unique. I am not in a position to judge another person nor should I take others' judgments of me too much to heart. There have been so many tiny variables that have gone into shaping who I am - my path has been my own and all those around me have a path that is their own. I cannot really judge another person because I could not possibly have enough information to truly see the whole story, to understand in full and fair measure just what has gone into making another person tick. It is difficult enough to understand myself. Why do I feel I am so capable of judging another fairly?
