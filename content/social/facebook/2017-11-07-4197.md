Even as I have tried to be cautious in my behaviors towards women over the course of my professional life, I find it hard not to wonder if I, even unknowingly and inadvertently, may have contributed to this blight on our society. Even if we have not committed acts of harassment, we shouldnât be blind to what has been going on around us. While we may not have experienced what the women who are now stepping forward to share their shame and hurt, we might all want to ask ourselves #MeToo?
