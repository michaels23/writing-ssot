I just had (another) wasp commit suicide using my forehead. She didn't sting me. (I've checked several times.) It did hurt, though. She must have been flying awfully fast. (She bounced three feet and didn't move.)

If it wasn't a suicide, there's one less blind wasp in the world. How else could she miss an obstacle as big as me?
