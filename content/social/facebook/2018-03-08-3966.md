The downside of all this thinking might be that we came to believe, since the Enlightenment, that faith is something that we do in our heads. Whereas the biblical concept of faith is that we love God "with our heart, mind, soul, strength" (and by strength, the Hebrew scriptures effectively meant "influence" or "wealth"), we tend to think of faith as what we think to be the way God is, and how we think we ought to respond to him. But even in its etymological roots in the Old English, the word believe is not related to verbs about thought or creed, but is related to the word for "love". The word "creed" itself is from the Latin "credo", which is a portmanteau or elision of earlier Latin phonemes "cor" and "do", which mean, "I give (my) heart". Put another way by the great Jesuit activist Fr. Daniel Berrigan,  âYour faith is rarely where your head is at, just as rarely where your heart is at. Your faith is where your ass is at! Where are you living? What are you doing? These thingsâour actions, our charity, our moralityâare what determine whether we believe or not.â
