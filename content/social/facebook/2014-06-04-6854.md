Education will always find a way.

I noticed a 'herd' of about thirty preschoolers while driving home this morning. (Note 1: anyone offended by unintended subhuman implications of the term 'herd' should consult the two haggard parents assigned to 'shepherd' detail on either end of the line. If those parents read this, they will nod vigorously while catching their breath.) At first I thought it was a field trip, until I noticed two similar 'herds' a block further east. (Note 2: I don't usually drive slowly enough to notice much of anything, but that's a topic for a different day.)

As usual, the over-developed left hemisphere of my brain began analyzing the logistics. It was clearly a lot of work to safely shepherd so many toddlers along a moderately busy city street. How were they accomplishing all of this? Come to think of it, why were they accomplishing all of this? Left Hem got its answers when I realized I was (for perhaps the 1000th time) coming up on our local PICA (Parents in Community Action) Head Start center. 

That's when the right hemisphere of my brain came back from wherever it goes on vacation. Right Hem notices the rainbow of diversity I saw in those children. If the future remains unaltered, that diversity will dwindle significantly by the time they reach high school. That saddens me, but I spent the rest of the drive in gratitude that such programs are available, though under frequent political attack.

Most of my friends already know that I am a strong proponent of early childhood education (ECE). I know it had a very positive effect on my development. [Insert sarcastic retorts here.] I'm grateful that my first assignment working for the state of Minnesota was supporting ECE. 

Nevertheless, there are factions in Minnesota (and elsewhere, I'm sure) that resist ECE. They make some good points. (To be fair, I should acknowledge that almost everyone who disagrees with me does make some good points. Darn it.) I can understand them disagreeing with parents who want to enroll their children in ECE programs. What I fail to understand is why they want to prevent parents from enrolling their children in ECE programs.

That's not true. That was a setup. I do have a theory. (Don't I always?)

I think it's part of the 21st century version of the ancient practice of attempting to keep the under-educated under-educated. There are many examples throughout human history. The one I think of most often is the illegality of teaching American slaves to read. Still, many found a way. It saddens me to recall that there are still communities on this Earth that prohibit educating women. Still, many find a way. That spirit encourages me.

In my calmer, more lucid [Insert sarcastic retorts here.] moments, I believe repression is ultimately futile. Regressives can slow progress, but they can't prevent it. I firmly believe that humanity will continue to evolve (There. I even said the 'e' word.), physically and spiritually.  No matter how hard others may try to prevent it, people will find a way to educate themselves, and their children. I believe it's only a matter of time.

I'm reminded of the scene in Jurassic Park (How's that for an obscure connection?) when Sam Neill discovered that a dinosaur population with no males (another interesting topic for another day) somehow fertilized eggs. Life found a way.

Similarly, the nature of people is freedom. I don't know if my friend Tom Conry originated that assertion, but he's the first I remember hearing it from. That was his summary of Genesis and Exodus. He taught that those stories were preserved to remind future generations that, no matter how strong the oppressor, the oppressed ultimately find freedom. It may take centuries, but it always happens. Think of it: always.

That gives me hope that, someday, everyone that wants education will be able to get it, without barriers. We're getting there. It may not happen in my lifetime, but I will always (well, usually) believe that.
