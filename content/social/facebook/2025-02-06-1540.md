"As the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world, the United States has a moral imperative to protect human dignity and make things better for as many people as possible based on Jesusâ principle that âto whom much has been given, much is requiredâ (Luke 12:48). For those of us who are motivated by our Christian faith, foreign assistance is also an important way we can encourage our society to act according to the moral priorities Jesus taught us in Matthew 25, when he explained that the way we treat people in the most vulnerable situations is how we treat Jesus himself. Just as Jesus never confined the boundaries of that commitment to Judea or Israel, neither should we confine our moral commitment to only 50 states." ~ Adam Russell Taylor
