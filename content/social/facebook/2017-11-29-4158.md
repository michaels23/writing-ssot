"With this conviction, Jesus could face the darkness mustering its forces against him. He could preach peace to the very end. He could walk, profoundly alone, into the garden of despair and make it a garden of determination. He could remain silent before his accusers, because there was no need to beg for his tormentorsâ mercy. Only Godâs mercy mattered." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
