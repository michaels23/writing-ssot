"Jesus cut through all such nonsense. People wage wars, but God does something else. God wages peace, and in time God will have the victory. In the end, history belongs to God, not to Charlemagne, Napoleon, Hitler or any other puffed-up coward who sends people to their deaths. Whatever wars we wage or rumors of wars that we use to intimidate the weak, the fields of Gettysburg and Flanders and the Bulge and Hiroshima and Vietnam and Charlottesville, VA, and wherever people do their worst to each other â may lie in blood-soaked ruins, But God is the Lord of all creation." ~Tom Ehrich
