"Jesus has been claimed as the poster-child for anti-Semitism. But that is a gross distortion. He turned against the Jewish establishment, but not against all Jews or Judaism as such. He suggested that self-serving elites had distorted the faith and made God small. The people were hungry for a life-giving faith, and so he fed them. They wanted a justice that elites in any age never want to allow. He acted on their behalf. He broke through the narrow boundaries of tribe. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
