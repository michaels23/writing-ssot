Ridicule and shame are really ineffective techniques of persuasion. Well, they were effective when we were growing up, but I can't remember a single occasion when I, or any other adult, actually opened our minds to a different perspective as a result of shame or ridicule. This leaves me asking myself ...

Why do I like them so much?
