While watching the coverage of the vandalism in South Minneapolis last night, the critical thinker in me latched on to these assertions made by the reporter on scene:

"The third precinct building is on fire." The first few times he said this, the only visible flames were from the burning liquor store across the street. He continued to make that assertion even after the cameras zoomed in on the fire they had indeed started in the parking lot of the third precinct. By time they cut back to normal programming, about an hour later, as far as I could see, the building still wasn't on fire.

"The protesters have entered the building." How does he know it was *protesters* entering the building? Isn't it possible they were just vandals taking advantage of the chaos?

"This is what the people wanted all along." (He was referring to the takeover of the precinct building.) Was he taking it upon himself to determine the motives of everyone involved? Are we to believe that the protests, looting, and vandalism since George Floyd's death were all planned with the goal of destroying that building?
