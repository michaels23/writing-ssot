We canât make the self-defeating calculation that if I can just keep my Medicare, it doesnât matter what Trump does to the health care of others. If I can just keep industrial toxins out of my streams, it doesnât matter when Trump opens other waters to destruction. The counterattack by champions of democracy starts in recognizing, âWe are all in this together.â
