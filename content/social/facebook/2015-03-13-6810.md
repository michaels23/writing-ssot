"Another key factor in the resurgence of recycling is that automation has allowed recycling centers to cheaply take on all the burdens of purifying a mixed recycling scheme. Primarily pioneered by European companies, automated facilities could use the material properties of various recycled materials to separate them out from a single stream, relying on everything from the material's density to its magnetic properties. Different plastics can even be identified based on their chemistry, which affects their absorbance of infrared wavelengths."
