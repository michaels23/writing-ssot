"In a way, this is the agony that many Americans are facing. Our nation no longer leads the world in the things that matter. We have fallen behind in education, medicine, heavy-industry, automobiles, affordability of housing, to name a few. Our financial institutions cheat and prey on the weak. We are torn apart by racial animosity. Our best minds are pouring their brain-power into gadgets and corporate law, not into medical research, food production, or industrial innovation." ~ Tom Erich
