In his victory speech, Trump promised that âweâre going to help our country healâ and that he would fight for âevery citizen.â

I hope and pray that he meant those words and not the alarming rhetoric and vision of the future he cast throughout his campaign. But we must also be prepared for the very real scenario that Trump meant what he said when he promised to go after the âenemies from withinâ or to conduct mass deportations â and that many Americans want him to carry out these commitments, even if that means undermining or destroying our democratic norms and system.
