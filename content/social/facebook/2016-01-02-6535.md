"But still we hope. Still we believe that God isn't done with America. Still we believe that common sense will prevail;, as it has in the past, and a basic optimism in the American spirit will reassert itself. Still we make plans for the future, even though the bad folks will do everything possible to deny that future." ~ Tom Ehrich
