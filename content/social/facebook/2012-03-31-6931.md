Want vs. need

At the buffet, taking more than I need is inconsistent with my values, and has unintended consequences.

Buying a bigger house than I will ever need is inconsistent with my values, and has unintended consequences.
Buying more car than I will ever need is inconsistent with my values, and has unintended consequences. 
(Come to think of it, driving my car instead of taking the bus is inconsistent with my values, and has unintended consequences. )
Hoarding my wealth is inconsistent with my values, and has unintended consequences. 
Hoarding my love is inconsistent with my values, and has unintended consequences. 

â¦ and yet, I keep doing all of the above.

Sigh; progress, not perfection.
