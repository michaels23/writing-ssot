"Though the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that the government should âfacilitateâ Abrego Garciaâs return, Trump has so far defied those orders, claiming that the decision of whether Abrego Garcia will be returned rests solely with Mr. Bukele, who used his White House visit to assert, with Trumpâs clear approval, that he will do no such thing. This sets an alarming precedent, suggesting that the U.S. government can send someone to a prison in a foreign country without even accusing them of a crime â and the person has no recourse to our justice system for any hope of relief." ~ J.K. Granberg-Michaelson
