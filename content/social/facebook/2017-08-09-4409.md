What I wouldn't give for the courage Jesus had - 

"Donât be afraid of what God is doing, even when it is challenging to you. Donât be afraid of changing your life. Donât be afraid of being a disciple and thus an apostle to a sinful and broken world. Donât be afraid when the powers of darkness push back." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
