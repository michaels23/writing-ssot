"Amazing Grace" was probably sung in a lot of churches this weekend, preparing to hear, or reflecting on, the gospel parables. When I was a teenager, I had a problem with the line 'saved a wretch like me." I think I had some sense of being a sinner. But God loved me, so I couldn't possibly be a wretch." ~Rory Cooney
