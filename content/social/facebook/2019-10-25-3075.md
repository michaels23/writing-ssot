A Sevier County Commission meeting in east Tennessee got ugly on Monday night when longtime Commissioner Warren Hurst broke into a disgusting rant about the "liberal agenda."

The meeting was centered around whether the county should become a gun sanctuary.

"We've got a queer runnin' for president, if that ain't about as ugly as you can get," Hurst said referring to openly-gay Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.
