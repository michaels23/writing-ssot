My chat with Google Gemini:

Me: Who was the elderly St. Paul man taken out of his home by ICE in freezing weather wearing little clothing?

Gemini: The man you are referring to is ChongLy Thao, a 57-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who also goes by the name Scott (or "Saly").

The incident, which took place on Sunday, January 18, 2026, sparked widespread outrage after videos and photos of his detention circulated online. Here are the key details of the event:

The Incident
The Raid: Federal ICE agents reportedly forced open the door of Mr. Thao's home on the East Side of St. Paul without presenting a warrant. His family, including his 4-year-old grandson, was held at gunpoint during the encounter.

Extreme Conditions: Despite the freezing Minnesota winterâwith temperatures between 10Â°F and 14Â°Fâagents led Mr. Thao out of his house in only his boxer shorts and Crocs. He managed to grab a thin blanket from his grandson to wrap around his shoulders as he was marched into the snow.

Wrongful Detention: Mr. Thao was driven to another location, fingerprinted, and photographed. It was only after approximately an hour or two that agents confirmed his identity as a U.S. citizen with no criminal record and returned him home.

The Response
DHS Justification: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initially claimed they were looking for two convicted sex offenders and that Mr. Thao "matched the description" and "refused to be fingerprinted."

Contradicting Facts: Mr. Thao's family and St. Paul officials, including Mayor Kaohly Her, vehemently disputed the DHS account. Reporting later revealed that one of the men ICE was searching for had already been in a Minnesota prison since 2024.

Community Impact: Mr. Thao, who fled Laos with his parents in 1974, expressed deep trauma following the event, telling reporters he felt "fear, shame, and desperation" and that he no longer feels safe in his own home.

Me: Even if Mr. Thao had been a convicted sex offender, wouldn't law enforcement still need a warrant to enter his home?

Gemini: That is a central point of the legal and political debate surrounding the detention of ChongLy "Scott" Thao on January 18, 2026.

Under standard interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, the short answer is yes: law enforcement typically needs a judicial warrant (signed by a judge) to enter a private home, regardless of a personâs criminal history. However, a controversial new policy and certain exceptions for those under supervision complicate the "real-world" application that occurred in St. Paul.

1. Judicial vs. Administrative Warrants
The primary conflict in Mr. Thao's case stems from a distinction between two types of warrants:

Judicial Warrant: Signed by a neutral judge who has reviewed evidence and found "probable cause." This is the only type of warrant that historically grants law enforcement the authority to break down a door or enter a home without consent.

Administrative Warrant (ICE Form I-205): Signed by an ICE official, not a judge. For decades, legal experts and ICEâs own handbooks stated these did not authorize home entry without consent.

The 2026 Shift: Just days before the St. Paul incident, an internal ICE memo (issued by Acting Director Todd M. Lyons) began instructing agents that they could use administrative warrants to forcibly enter homes if the target has a final order of removal. This memo is currently being challenged in court as unconstitutional, but it was the basis for the agents' actions at Mr. Thao's home.

2. Does a Conviction Change the Rules?
If the person ICE was looking for had been a convicted sex offender, their rights might be different in specific scenarios:

Probation or Parole: If an individual is on active supervision, they often sign a "search clause" as a condition of their release. This allows probation officers (and sometimes police) to search their home with reasonable suspicion rather than a full warrant.

ICE Limitations: Even with a search clause, that authority is usually granted to local probation/parole officers. Immigration agents generally do not have the same "search clause" authority unless they are working in a specific joint task force or have a judicial warrant.

3. The Error in the St. Paul Case
Even if the new ICE policy were legally sound, it failed on several fronts in the case of Mr. Thao:

Wrongful Identity: Mr. Thao was not the target. Agents reportedly stopped his son earlier that day and used a borrowed car as a "match" for a target, but failed to verify that the man inside the house was actually the person they were seeking.

Citizenship: As a naturalized U.S. citizen, Mr. Thao is not subject to "administrative removal" or ICE's jurisdiction in the same way a non-citizen with an order of deportation would be.

No Active Search Clause: Since Mr. Thao had no criminal record, there was no legal "supervision" status that would have waived his Fourth Amendment right to be secure in his home.

Key Takeaway
While DHS attempted to justify the raid by citing the severity of the crimes of the people they thought were inside, the U.S. Constitution generally prohibits using the "nature of the crime" to bypass the warrant requirement for a private residence.

Me: Did the ICE agents present such an Administrative Warrant?

Gemini: No, according to the family and eyewitness accounts, the ICE agents did not present a warrant before or during the forced entry into ChongLy "Scott" Thao's home.

Mr. Thao and his family have been very consistent on this point in multiple interviews following the January 18, 2026, incident:

Forced Entry: Mr. Thao stated that agents began banging on the door while he was napping. When he told his daughter-in-law not to open it, agents used force to break the door down.

Direct Testimony: Mr. Thao told the Associated Press: "I was shaking. They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door."

Refusal to See ID: Even when Mr. Thao asked his daughter-in-law to retrieve his identification to prove his citizenship, agents reportedly told him they "didn't want to see it" at that time.

The "Hidden" Authority: The May 2025 Memo
While agents did not present a judicial warrant, they were likely acting under a controversial and secretive internal policy. A May 12, 2025, memorandum issued by ICE leadership changed the agency's long-standing protocol.

Historically, ICE's own training manuals stated that an Administrative Warrant (Form I-205)âwhich is signed by an ICE official rather than a judgeâdid not grant the authority to enter a private home without consent. However, the 2025 memo instructed agents that they could use "necessary and reasonable force" to enter homes using only these administrative forms.

Legal Discrepancies
There has been significant confusion regarding documentation after the fact:

Post-Raid Documents: In some other St. Paul raids that same week, residents reported finding "warrants" left on their doorsteps the following day. These were often found to be missing case numbers, file stamps, or specific names, leading local officials and legal experts to question their legitimacy.

Inapplicability to Citizens: Even if the agents had a valid administrative immigration warrant, it would have been legally void for Mr. Thao. Because he is a naturalized U.S. citizen, he is not subject to administrative removal orders, meaning ICE had no jurisdiction to "warrant" his arrest for immigration purposes in the first place.

St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison have both cited the lack of a judicial warrant in this case as a primary reason for their ongoing federal lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security.

Me: Do ICE agents swear any oath to uphold the US Constitution?

Gemini: Yes, ICE agentsâlike all federal law enforcement officers and civil servantsâare legally required to swear an oath to uphold the United States Constitution.

This requirement is rooted in Article VI of the Constitution itself, which mandates that all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several States, "shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution."

The Federal Oath of Office
The specific language for the oath taken by ICE agents is codified in 5 U.S.C. Â§ 3331. Every agent must sign and swear to this text upon entering service:

"I, [Name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."

Relevance to the St. Paul Incident
The controversy surrounding the detention of ChongLy "Scott" Thao in January 2026 centers on whether the agents violated this very oath.

The Fourth Amendment: This is the specific part of the Constitution that protects citizens against "unreasonable searches and seizures" and requires that "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause."

The Conflict: Legal experts and the Minnesota Attorney General argue that by entering Mr. Thao's home without a judicial warrant, the agents disregarded the Fourth Amendment.

The "Policy vs. Oath" Debate: The agents were likely following an internal May 2025 ICE memo that claimed administrative warrants granted them entry power. However, civil rights attorneys argue that an internal agency memo cannot override a constitutional amendment, and that an agent's primary loyalty must be to the Constitution they swore to defend, not a conflicting administrative policy.

Training on the Oath
ICE agents receive training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), where they are specifically taught that the Fourth Amendment generally prevents them from entering a home (an area with a "Reasonable Expectation of Privacy") without consent or a judge-signed warrant. The St. Paul incident is often cited by critics as a moment where agency directives and constitutional oaths came into direct, public conflict.

Me: Did Todd M. Lyons swear any oath to uphold the US Constitution?

Gemini: Yes, Todd M. Lyons has sworn an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution.

As a federal official and law enforcement officer, Mr. Lyons has been required by law and the Constitution to take this oath at multiple stages of his career. According to the biographical and professional information available:

1. Points of Career Oaths
Military Service: He first took the oath when he entered the U.S. Air Force in 1993.

Law Enforcement: He took it again when he began his civilian law enforcement career in Florida in 1999 and when he joined ICE as an agent in 2007.

Executive Leadership: Upon being named the Acting Director (or "Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director") of ICE on March 9, 2025, he was required to reaffirm the federal oath of office.

2. The Legal Obligation
Under Article VI of the Constitution and 5 U.S.C. Â§ 3331, every individual appointed to a federal office must swear or affirm that they will "support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic" and that they will "bear true faith and allegiance to the same."

3. Tension with Current Actions
The incident involving ChongLy "Scott" Thao has brought Mr. Lyons' oath into public focus. Legal critics and officials like St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her argue that the tactics authorized by the May 12, 2025, memorandumâwhich Mr. Lyons authoredâdirectly conflict with the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless home entries.

While the memo instructed agents to use "necessary and reasonable force" to enter homes based on administrative warrants, legal challenges in the wake of the St. Paul incident argue that such an agency-level directive cannot supersede the constitutional oath to protect the sanctity of a private residence.

Me: So, did Mr. Lyons violate his oath when he issued that memo?

The question of whether Acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons violated his oath of office is currently at the center of a major constitutional showdown in federal court.

There is no simple "yes" or "no" because the answer depends on which legal interpretation of the Fourth Amendment eventually prevails. However, the arguments on both sides are clearly defined by the lawsuits and whistleblower disclosures that emerged in January 2026.

The Case for "Yes" (Violation of the Oath)
Critics, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, the ACLU, and whistleblowers from within the DHS, argue that Lyons violated his oath to "support and defend the Constitution" by issuing the May 12, 2025, memorandum. Their arguments include:

Bypassing the Fourth Amendment: The Fourth Amendment explicitly protects the "sanctity of the home." For decades, legal precedent has held that an administrative warrant (signed by an agency official) is not a substitute for a judicial warrant (signed by a judge) for the purpose of forcing entry into a private residence.

Contradicting Established Training: Whistleblowers revealed that ICEâs own training manuals, as recently as early 2025, stated agents cannot enter a home without consent or a judicial warrant. By issuing a memo that overrode this long-standing constitutional safeguard, critics argue Lyons knowingly directed agents to act unconstitutionally.

The "Citizen" Factor: The incident with ChongLy "Scott" Thao is being used as evidence of a "failure of process." Since the memo authorized entry based on a lower standard of proof, it led to a U.S. citizen being dragged out of his home in his underwearâan act that even many conservative legal scholars agree is a "seizure" that lacks any constitutional justification.

The Case for "No" (Upholding the Law)
Todd M. Lyons and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defend the memo as a lawful exercise of federal authority. Their defense includes:

Administrative Authority: DHS argues that Title 8 of the U.S. Code gives immigration officers the power to arrest people with final orders of removal. They contend that because these individuals have already gone through the immigration court system, their "due process" has been satisfied, and a separate judicial warrant is not required to execute the final order.

The "Good Faith" Argument: Lyons has stated that the allegations in the Minnesota lawsuit are "completely false and baseless." His supporters argue that he is fulfilling his oath by enforcing federal immigration laws that local "sanctuary" jurisdictions are allegedly obstructing.

Targeting Convicted Criminals: DHS claims the policy was designed to catch "dangerous sex offenders" (though this defense was complicated by the fact that the targets of the St. Paul raid were not actually in the house and Mr. Thao was an innocent citizen).

Current Status
The matter is currently being litigated in the case of Minnesota vs. Department of Homeland Security (2026).

The Ellison Lawsuit: Filed on January 12, 2026, it seeks a permanent injunction to block the May 2025 memo and end the "Operation Metro Surge" in Minnesota.

The Whistleblower Complaint: Whistleblower Aid is representing DHS employees who claim they were threatened with retaliation if they did not follow the memo's "illegal" instructions.

Ultimately, a federal judge (and likely the Supreme Court) will determine if the memoâs instructions were a "faithful discharge of duties" or an unconstitutional overreach.
