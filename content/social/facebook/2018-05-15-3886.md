"A Comcast spokesperson initially disputed our findingsâeven though they were based entirely on the results provided by Comcast's website. The Comcast spokesperson told us that a new customer can't sign up for service online at an address that currently has a paying Comcast customer, because its system has a business rule in place to automatically flag such an address. Comcast told us that in these cases, a new customer would be required to talk to a Comcast agent, who would presumably ensure that the current resident is actually moving out before allowing the new customer to hook up to Comcast's network. Because of that, Comcast told us that we shouldn't assume that the installation fee listed on its website would actually be charged."
