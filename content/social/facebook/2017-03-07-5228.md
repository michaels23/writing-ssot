"Interestingly, God has been quite clear about what âgreatâ means to God. Godâs greatness comes as a blessing from God, not an arsenal of arms. The âgreat nationâ that God would make of Abraham was about people, not about a state. People would be transformed, and they themselves would become a âblessingâ to other peoples. Their âname,â like Godâs name, would be invoked by people seeking God." ~Tom Ehrich
