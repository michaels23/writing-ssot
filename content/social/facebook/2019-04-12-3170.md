But when Christians say âJesus is Lord,â we donât mean that Jesus is a Lord like Constantine or Charlemagne or King Henry. We have no experience of Jesus being like that. To the contrary, Jesus had a completely subversive view of leadership: âWhoever would be first among you must serve the rest.â When we say âJesus is Lord,â we mean that lordship is redefined by who Jesus is. ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
