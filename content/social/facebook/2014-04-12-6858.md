For the first time in over five months, there is no frozen water on my property, other than the man-made variety I use to chill beverages. On the downside, I just plucked my first two dandelions of 2014. Combined, these two milestones give me the confidence to use a word I've avoided for several weeks, lest I jinx the entire Northern Hemisphere.
