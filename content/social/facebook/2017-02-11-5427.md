"So, I ask, must everything be political? My answer, a resounding âYes!â
 
This is exactly what people in a functioning democracy should be doing. In a democracy, politics is about all of us. Every decision made adds to or detracts from our freedom. Every action bolsters democratic institutions or chips away at them. If we find ourselves in a fascist state, as many fear, it will have happened one edict at a time, one distraction, one unanswered challenge, one norm violated, one right questioned and then trashed. We wonât have a coup, we will have death in a thousand stages."
