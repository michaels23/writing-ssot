My prophesy for the 2016 World Series:
1. Cleveland wins games 1, 2, & 3.
2. Chicago wins games 4, 5, & 6.
3. Game 7 is scoreless until the bottom of the 12th.
4. Cleveland has a runner on 3rd with one out. Batter hits medium fly to right. Fielder makes the catch. Runner tags. Fielder throws to plate.
5. Before the ball arrives, the last words any of us hear: âLet there be light.â
