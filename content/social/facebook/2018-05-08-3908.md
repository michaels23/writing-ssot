What people donât know is, in the Moral Monday Movement, about 11% of the people were Republicans. We went into counties and organized that were 99% white, 89% Republican. And what we found is that the Southern strategy had worked. Its design was by Kevin Phillips, he told Richard Nixon that we (editorâs note: in this paragraph the âweâ is the Republicans)can find a way to pit people against each other, and we can find a way to make them hate each other and blame other people for their problems without using race language. Well, racial language that sounds racist. So instead weâre talking about tax cuts and statesâ rights, forced busing, and racialized entitlement programs. If we can do this long enough, and if we can add to that, somehow bring in the slave master type religion and morality into the 20th century without it sounding racist, we can actually get people to vote against their own interests and not even believe that theyâre doing so.
