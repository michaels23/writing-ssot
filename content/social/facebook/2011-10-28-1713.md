The mega-rich and powerful have overreached again. They do that. If your spirit centers in accumulation, enough is never enough. Avarice and hubris donât know how to stop. 

Avarice breeds corruption, for itâs always easier to steal wealth than to earn it. Corruption, in turn, finds plenty of enablers, like public officials who carry water for the wealthy.
