Just returned from a wonderful week (almost) visiting family and friends. By that I mean it was wonderful for Linda and me. I can also risk putting those words in the mouths of said family and friends. The dog we left behind, on the other hand ...

I was just gleefully greeted by the front end of the dog. The other end was wagging and wiggling, but I think that was a combination distractor and distributor for what can most discretely be described as a 'Best-in-Show ... revenge ... fragrance.'
