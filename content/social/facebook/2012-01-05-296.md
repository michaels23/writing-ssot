"As a Christian, however, I am appalled at candidates' flagrant abuse of the Gospel. They trumpet the worst kind of religion: judgmental, harsh, legalistic, exclusionary, demagogic...

... they turn prayer into a weapon, Jesus into their partisan, and God into a monster. They score points in the culture wars by trashing a Messiah whose actual words and deeds sound nothing like their stump speeches."
