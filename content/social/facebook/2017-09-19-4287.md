"Jesus told a parable about that good life. In his case, the author of good was the landowner, representing God. He knew what it took for a worker to feed his family. That is what he paid them, despite later and later starting times. The point was to feed people, not to be clever in devising wage differentials. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
