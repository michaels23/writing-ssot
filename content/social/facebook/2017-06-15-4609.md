"We learn everything (we learn what is "normal") by imitating other humans, starting with our parents. We learn to walk, talk, eat certain foods with certain utensils, everything, all by observing and imitation. Weâre taught who is good and who is bad by those around us, who weâre like and who weâre not like, who is better than we are, and who we are better than. "Normal" is learned behavior." ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
