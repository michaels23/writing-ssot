"But there is another option, one that seems to be ignored: we could simply accept North Koreaâs offer to do what we are demanding. China and North Korea have already proposed that North Korea freeze its nuclear and missile programs. The proposal, though, was rejected at once by Washington, just as it had been two years earlier, because it includes a quid pro quo: it calls on the United States to halt its threatening military exercises on North Koreaâs borders, including simulated nuclear-bombing attacks by B-52s." ~Noam Chomsky
