saw an ... interesting ... site on the bus home from work today. I walked past a woman wearing a Susan G. Komen jacket. At least, that's what I think it was. She quickly put her hand over the logo as I got closer. 

I found a seat three rows behind her. Over the next 20 minutes, she put her hand over that logo six times as other riders went by.
