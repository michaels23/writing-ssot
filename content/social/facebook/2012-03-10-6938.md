We are surrounded by a way of life in which betterment is understood as expansion, as acquisition, as fame. Everyone wants to get more â to be on top â no matter what it is the top of thatâs admired. Thereâs nothing recent about the temptation. Itâs the oldest sin in the book. The one that got Adam tossed out of the garden and Lucifer tossed out of heaven. What is new about it is the general admiration and approval it receives.

~ Eugene Peterson in A Long Obedience
