[Jesus of Nazareth | Muhammad ibn Abdullah | The Buddha | Moses | ...] was walking along a beach and discovered an old lamp poking out of the sand. 
[Muhammad ibn Abdullah | Jesus of Nazareth | The Buddha | Moses | ...] pulled the lamp out of the sand and began to clean it. 
As [The Buddha | Muhammad ibn Abdullah | Jesus of Nazareth | Moses | ...] rubbed, a genie suddenly appeared from the lamp.

"Thank you for freeing me from the lamp! In gratitude, I grant you one wish. What is your most fervent desire?"

[Moses | The Buddha | Muhammad ibn Abdullah | Jesus of Nazareth | ...] responded, "That every human forgive all grievances: past, present, and future ... and continue to do so until the end of time."
