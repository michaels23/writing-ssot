"Ask yourself which is safer, being able to walk down the street without fear or to walk down the street armed against threat? Feeling safe is an inner quality, and once you have it, you are sustained by it. The same is true of everything else that an age of faith assigned to God." ~ @[100044282026822:2048:Deepak Chopra]
