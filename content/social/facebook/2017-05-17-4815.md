"A nation can be poorly led, and in all likelihood, can survive being poorly led. But we cannot survive mass corruption. When the people turn against each other -- as Trump is trying to cause -- and when they become as sordid and self-serving as their leaders, all is lost.This is what Hannah Arendt learned in studying Nazi Germany; it is what we glimpse in the dereliction of a weak and compromised Congress. We citizens must not allow corruption to spread into every community and into our homes." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
