"The Roman empire, like empires before and after it, offered a version of âpeaceâ to civilization. That peace was based on military victory, upon force and threat of force. In exchange for the peace and protection of the legions, subject states were allowed a measure of civil and religious autonomy. Paying for the presence and readiness of those legions was not inexpensive, however, and tribute taxes were collected from every subject in every country to pay for the salaries and expenses of the occupation forces as well as to fill the imperial coffers in Rome. The pax Romana worked pretty well for the Romans. Less so for the rest of the world." ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
