"I pray because I want to express my values and then measure those according to Godâs values. I want to be a Godly person. But that wonât happen just in being nice among the nice. Being a Godly person means choosing to care for the least of these even when bullies are tormenting them. It means loving all whom God has made even when haters are shouting for blood. It means confession even when the arrogant refuse to apologize. It means telling the truth even as liars are sweeping the field and claiming there is no truth." ~Tom Ehrich
