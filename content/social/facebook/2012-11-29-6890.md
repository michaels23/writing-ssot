Hi Facebook friends & family,

Again, I must apologize for blind-siding some with this wide-net announcement, but my brother Chris passed away early yesterday. I'm on my way to San Francisco now to make arrangements.

I'm grateful that Chris died peacefully and painlessly. I don't think he knew this was the end. According to the nurses, he just drifted off and they couldn't wake him. It was over soon after.
