Oklahoma City police Capt. Bo Mathews said at a news conference Wednesday that officers thought Magdiel Sanchez, 35, was not obeying their commands before one shot him with a gun and the other with a Taser. Matthews said witnesses were yelling "he can't hear you" before the officers fired, but the officers didn't hear the witnesses.
