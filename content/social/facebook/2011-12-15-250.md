I understand why God sent the angel Gabriel to a 14-year-old girl. If, as Luke believed, God was going to reset creation and bring about a ânew Adam,â he needed to break free of old words, old arguments, old expectations, old boundaries, and allow something entirely fresh to occur.

Whether or not Mary was a âvirginâ in the sexual sense â the Hebrew word means âyoung girlâ â she was untainted by oldness, not shackled by inheritance, and her son could be born outside the bleak determinacy of original sin.
