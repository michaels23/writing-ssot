"Racism has already been a powerful force in the U.S. for at least the past hundred years, its impact worsened by the dismantling of welfare support and the mass incarceration policies of the Bill Clinton Administration which exacerbated  the vast economic inequalities in the U.S. which have disproportionately fallen onto the backs of people of color. The Obama Administrationâs failure to implement any serious anti-racist strategy, e.g. requiring publicly funded schools to teach an anti-racist curriculum, coupled with a response to the economic crisis that tilted heavily toward the interests of Wall Street and the American corporate elite without comparable concern for the millions of poor and middle income victims of corporate malfeasance left many working people feeling that the promises of the Democrats could not be trusted." ~Rabbi Michael Lerner
