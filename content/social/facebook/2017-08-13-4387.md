"The powers of evil have set their sights on freedom, tolerance, and dreamers. Like their soulmates in Nazi Germany, they swaggered â âlocked and loadedâ â into the public square and dared anyone to push back. Perhaps the evil one thinks Americans are already so divided that they wonât push back." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
