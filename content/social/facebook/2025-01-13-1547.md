My dog just punched me in the fist with her nose. Based solely on still photography, I could be cited for animal cruelty. The full video, however, would provide evidence that she initiated the contact. In fact, she was barely aware of it. Conversely, my hand is already swelling up. 

I wonder if this is an example of "Life isn't fair."
