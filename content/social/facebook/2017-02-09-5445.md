"I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses,â said Moses. âChoose life.â

That was it! That was the heart of Mosesâ teachings. Even more, it was the resolution to all arguments about free will and Godâs supposed âplanâ for humanity. It cut through all the passive theologies about our merely walking a path that God has already determined, and all arrogant theologies about the âelectâ and the âprosperousâ being favored by God." ~Tom Ehrich
