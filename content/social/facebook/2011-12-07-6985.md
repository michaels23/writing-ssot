âI see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness. I hear the ever-approaching thunder, which will destroy us too. I can feel the sufferings of millions and yet, if I look up into the heavens, I think that it will all come out right. In the meantime, I must uphold my ideals, for perhaps the time will come when I shall be able to carry them out.â

- Anne Frank, from The Diary of Anne Frank
