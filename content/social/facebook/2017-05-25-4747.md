"This, then, is the "rain in abundance" that humanity needs God to "shower abroad." What stands in the way? Not technology, but the will of the haves to share "water" with the have-nots. Politicians in developing lands don't want their subjects to become informed and capable. Societies mired in medieval practices don't want their people, especially their women, to see the larger world and the God who is active there. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
