The âourâ in âour fatherâ is bad news to people who put up fences, borders patrols, country clubs, anything that keeps my people in and everybody else out. So Jesus is executed eventually by the Romans in a form of capital punishment reserved for violators of the Pax Romana. Maybe the light of Tabor, the echo of the voice calling him âbeloved,â got him to the point where that was possible for him. His good news has rung down through the ages, giving courage to all those who, like Moses and Elijah before him, like so many who have come after him, were summoned by the Abba-God to speak the truth to power.
