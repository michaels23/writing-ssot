"Jesus was sending his people to show what living in right relationship with God looks like, sounds like, feels like. He didnât launch a tribe of moralizers claiming right-opinion and the right to rule others. He sent sinners and outcasts to bear the fruits of mercy and forgiveness." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
