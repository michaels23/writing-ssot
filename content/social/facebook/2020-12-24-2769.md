"Power does not corrupt. Fear corrupts, perhaps the fear of loss of power." John Steinbeck

I now see that much of what we perceive as power in the world is really fear. Power that seeks to attack first to feel secure is fear. Power that always demands an answer is fear. Power that arrogantly refuses to listen is fear. Spiritual power can be vulnerable. It can live with confusion. It can stand alone. It allows others to walk away to pursue their own happiness. Spiritual power can exist in suffering and loneliness and does not expect perfection. My recovery is teaching me to live and let others live, too. My freedom must respect the freedom of others. Respect is a two-way street.
Give me the power that can rest in imperfection.
