"I donât mean for this to be a political salvo, because weâre all guilty, but this year I feel that somebody ought to just say it: we Americans are the ones who are dead. We deal in death all over the world. We spend more money on weaponry than on anything else in the national budget, and sell the arms to just about anyone. No, weâre not alone in our obsession with promoting fear, threats, stand-offs, brinksmanship, embargoes, sanctions, shock-and-awe. But we seem to be the most blasÃ© about being arms merchants and Christians. We are dead, and the name of our death is War. " ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
