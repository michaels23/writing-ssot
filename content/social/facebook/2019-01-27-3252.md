"Last week we had a wakeup call as we celebrated with a couple over their childâs Baptism and how important it is to them to have a faith community. What was to us a simple celebration was parsed into a credal statement about every aspect of their life and the St. Joan community. Part of the problem was this was put on social media and went, as they say, viral."
