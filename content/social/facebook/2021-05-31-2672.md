Even though we are fostering her for a week or two before things are finalized, we want to introduce the almost-certain new member of the Lenc-Steigerwald family, Daenerys or âDanniâ. Daenerys (rhymes with âcanariesâ) comes from a character in Game of Thrones - a strong woman with an incredible sense of justice. (https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen) 

For those following along, Danni was formerly known as Dandelion. She was given that name as a stray and doesn't respond to it really well, so weâre modifying it to Danni. She is a Great Pyrenees, about a year old.
