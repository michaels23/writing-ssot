It's time to update my ever-growing list of questions people need not ask me.

1) If the question begins with, "Do you remember ...," my answer will always be 

"No."

2) *New* If the question begins with, "Did I tell you ...,'  my answer will usually be

"Probably."

unless I'm cranky, in which case my answer will be 

"How the hell should I know?"
