Boy, can I identify with this: 

Suddenly, a gaffe from my sixteenth year came to mind. I shuddered. Then came another ghost from Christmas past: different time, different place, another shudder-worthy gaffe. Then another.

What is this? Do I have an enormous room somewhere filled with file cabinets documenting my every failing, flaw, floundering and foible? Well, yes, I do. Itâs called my brain. And it seems to lurch into overdrive on the negative side whenever I have a rough day.
