"But such precedents and arguments do us little good if we donât act today. Christians have spent the past two thousand years arguing about what took place in Bethlehem, in Nazareth, in Jerusalem and on Calvary. Yes, the world changed, but those changes mean little if we donât then live into them. We argue about the Infancy Narrative, or what Jesus said about, say, sex (nothing) or power (a lot), but we still must face the new day, the new challenge, a future unlike anything people knew 2,000 years ago." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
