In the actual Gospel, heralds went to humble shepherds, not to religious leaders in their lavish temples or to imperial overlords. In the actual Gospel, hope was proclaimed for the poor and oppressed. In time, wealth from afar bowed before the Jewish baby and then proceeded onward by âanother way.â ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
