Jesus was a rescuer. They called him âredeemer,â âMessiah,â names that connote being rescued from oppression. Jesus didnât create rules, an institution, or rituals. He rescued people from disease, from mobs, from greed, from tragic lives, from death. He saw a need, stepped up, assessed the situation, and took action to make a difference. He got his hands dirty. ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
