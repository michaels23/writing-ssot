Board of director meetings are open to all members. (We just can't let you vote.) We will discuss upcoming programming for the club. We will be seeking ideas and input on events as well as looking for volunteers to lead and support the events. This is a great opportunity for alumni to get involved with the club and we hope to have a diverse turnout so we can program to meet the needs of the diverse alumni community in the area.
