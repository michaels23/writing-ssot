This is a chance to confess my (literal) prejudice. If I am to be truly honest with myself, I must admit that when I first see (with my eyes) someone of a different color or culture, I am a little afraid. 

I do pre-judge. I do fear change. I do fear 'differences,' at least at first. 

I like to think my prejudice ends there, or at least when I open my mind. I have a hunch that will be a lifelong effort, thought.
