"A nation with a longstanding global mission now seems small and cowardly, at best a snarling bully. International trade seems to be turning against isolationist America. Leaders in other nations are dismissing the American President as a nut-job and pathological liar. News media in America havenât bowed to Bannonâs âshut upâ demand. This could become a golden age for investigative reporting and truth-telling." ~Tom Ehrich
