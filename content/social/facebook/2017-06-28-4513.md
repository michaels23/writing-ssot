"In Godâs desired narrative, we would see each other as faith-leapers, or terrified risk-takers, and we would offer encouragement. We wouldnât gather as the the found, or the right, or the victors. We would admire the takers of risk. Itâs a big cliff to jump off of, no matter what method we deploy before hitting the water down below. Better to hold hands on the way down than to disparage the otherâs way of leaping." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
