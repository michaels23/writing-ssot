"Christianity should look at what Jesus said and did and pursue it boldly. That would require grappling with the prophetic vision of Isaiah, Micah and Amos, among others. It would require seeing justice as Godâs desire. It would feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, welcome the stranger, heal the sick, protect the vulnerable. It would put doing the right thing ahead of doing the safe thing."
   ~Tom Ehrich
