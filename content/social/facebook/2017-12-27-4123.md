"From beginning to end, Jesus was a Jew, and his brief messianic ministry makes no sense apart from Judaism. His teachings were about ancient Jewish themes of justice and equity. He was a prophet in the mold of Amos and Isaiah, not a religious emperor in the mold of Caesar. Honoring him meant going with him, not settling down and building grand icons. Believing in him meant doing what he did when it was sure to incur the worldâs wrath, not staging grand spectacles." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
