If Kavanaugh gets confirmed, which seems likely, I wonder what would happen if Dianne Feinstein or Kamala Harris then charged Christine Blasey Ford with perjury? 

Dr. Ford swore under oath she was 100% certain Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. Does that not imply that any Senator voting to confirm Kavanaugh believes Ford perjured herself? 

I assume such a perjury charge would necessitate a trial and associated investigation. If Ford was convicted of perjury, we would know that truth. If she was acquitted, would that not imply Kavanaugh was guilty of both the sexual assault and perjury?

On the other hand, maybe Trump should pardon both of them and be done with it.
