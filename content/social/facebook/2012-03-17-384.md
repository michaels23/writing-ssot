The film starts with President George W. Bushâs eulogy to Ford, which cites Fordâs threat to quit the team in response to Wardâs benching as a sign of the mettle that would someday make Ford presidential.

âLong before he was known in Washington, Gerald Ford showed his character and his leadership,â Bush said. âAs a star football player for the University of Michigan, he came face to face with racial prejudice when Georgia Tech came to Ann Arbor for a football game. One of Michiganâs best players was an African American student named Willis Ward. Georgia Tech said they would not take the field if a black man were allowed to play,â Bush continued. âFord was furious at Georgia Tech for making the demand, and for the University of Michigan for caving in. He agreed to play only after Willis Ward personally asked him to. The stand Gerald Ford took that day was never forgotten by his friend. And Gerald Ford never forgot that day eitherâand three decades later, he proudly supported the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act in the U.S. Congress.â
