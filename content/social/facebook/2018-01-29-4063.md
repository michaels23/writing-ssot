"This is the light in which we should see the ministry of Jesus. Over the centuries, we have turned it into an extravaganza, a spectacle unleashed by God on a world caught in sin. In fact, the ministry of Jesus was a small affair: a handful of people going from place to place, entering houses and responding to needs inside." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
