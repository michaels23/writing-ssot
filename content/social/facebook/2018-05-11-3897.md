The two clinics are no stranger to federal officialsâ bad sides; they have both received warnings and wrist-slaps in the past. In August of last year, the FDA sent a warning letter to US Stem Cell Clinic of Sunrise, Florida and its chief scientific officer Kristin Comella for âsignificant deviationsâ from good practices. That was shortly after researchers determined that three women had permanently lost their vision after the clinic posed as a legitimate research facility conducting a clinical trial and injected an unproven concoction of cells directly into their eyeballs. The women reported paying $5,000 for the procedure, and the clinicâs supposed clinical trial never took place.
