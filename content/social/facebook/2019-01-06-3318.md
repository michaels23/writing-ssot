"Lawmakers who oppose any border wall spending should know that they have the public on their side: Over 60 percent of Americans oppose Trumpâs border wall, and nearly 70 percent think it should not be a congressional priority. Polls have also found that residents of border states are strongly opposed to the wall. Just 35 percent of those surveyed most recently about the shutdown said they backed including money for the wall in a congressional spending bill. And only 25 percent said they supported Trump shutting down the government over the matter."
