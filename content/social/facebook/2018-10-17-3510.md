"Itâs all yours, but be prepared for what it costs. Study the Bible â and not just the heartwarming sections, but the prophets, the Sermon on the Mount, almost anything that Jesus actually taught, the sections that are hard to hear and even harder to follow. Give away your wealth. Stand with the humble and lowly. Speak truth to power. Risk rejection." ~Tom Ehrich
