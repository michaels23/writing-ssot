A friend asks:

"stories of old graveyards that were dug up for new construction of buildings etc. reveal buried folks that were believed to be dead, but before embalming techniques were used widely.  Reports were that some of the coffins broke open or otherwise enable inspection and many were found to have scratch marks on the inside of the lid.  Apparently, this was the result of the person not being fully dead and awaking in the coffin underground.

Presuming these reports are true ... why would God permit them to awake to such a final fate?  There was no chance for rescue and to awake and realize the situation you are in must be extreme torture.  If God were alive and paying attention, what possible reason could there be for simply not taking them while unconscious?"

to which I philosophize:

My theory is that such horrors are intended to teach survivors. Whoever discovered that people were being buried alive may have sparked the effort to learn more about what went wrong. "How can we make sure we don't do this again? We need to find ways to be absolutely certain dead people are really dead." 

The longer term and less direct results, I think, included medical advances that improved life for the living and prolonged life expectancy. I also hope realizing such horrors made us more humane as a species.
