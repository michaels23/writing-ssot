"The answer, if Pilate could have been honest, was: I fear for my kingdom. I fear competition with you. You have what I donât have. You have what many want. You have an integrity that I lack. You have a purpose larger than staying in office. You are a real person, the exemplar of what it means to be human, and the exemplar of what it means to be holy. I am neither. So I resent you and will do everything in my power to destroy you." ~Tom Ehrich
