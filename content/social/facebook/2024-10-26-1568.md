"Ever since Rome tried to quell the ministry of Jesus, nations â and their ardent worshippers â have tried to crush social justice because its goals and ideals are contradictory to nationalismâs aims of wealth, power, and domination. The work of social justice is the exact opposite of nationalism, the antithesis of exclusivity. Itâs inclusive because itâs loving. By its very nature, the pursuit of social justice cannot coexist with nationalism, which is why the two continually clash."
