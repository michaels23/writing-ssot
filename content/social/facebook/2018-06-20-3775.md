God is in the boat. In the storm-tossed boat, not in the board room, not in the parlor, not in the assembly hall bedecked with swastikas. God is in the boat. In the boat, where the windstorm is too great and people fear for their lives. In the boat, where the full force of the darkness is being felt. In the boat, where all seems lost. ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
