"This is not the first time we have had this issue. In December of 2017 while deployed to the Prado Mobilization Center supporting a series of large wildfires we had the same device with the same sim card also throttled. I was able to work through Eric Prosser at the time to have service to the device restored and Eric communicated that Verizon had properly re-categorized the device as truly "unlimited". In the email below Verizon is stating that they can restore the device for an extra $2/month. I obviously lack the authority to make such an approval. If we could get Verizon [to get] that approval I would appreciate it."
