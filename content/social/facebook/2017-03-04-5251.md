"Those of us who care about democracy and freedom have got to get serious. Stop bickering, stop parading our blissfully superior opinions, stop fussing about small stuff. Who cares if provocateur Kellyanne Conway sits like a teenager on a sofa in the Oval Office? Sheâs a diversion. I think the Russian Connection is a diversion, too. " ~Tom Ehrich
