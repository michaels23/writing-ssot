"The first portion has to do with harvesting in a way that maximizes benefits for all, rather than profits for the owner. Donât âreap to the very edges of your field,â Moses said, or make a second pass over the field to âgather the gleanings.â Rather, leave the edges and the gleanings for âthe poor and the alien.â Do the same with the vineyards, said Moses." ~Tom Ehrich
