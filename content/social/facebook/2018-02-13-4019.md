"It will help us to understand Jesus if we see him as Godâs Plan B. The Gospel of John tried to situate Jesus as part of Godâs plan on the day of creation. But the other gospels suggest that God had intended Israel to be his âbeacon to the nations,â his sacred tribe to draw humankind to holiness. When Israel got waylaid by its leadersâ self-serving and vanity, God decided to try again. Godâs new way was to call one man to serve in the way that God intended. He would call others, and they would do the same." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
