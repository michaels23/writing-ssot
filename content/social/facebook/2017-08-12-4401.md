This morning I went to my favorite Bruegger's for coffee. I must have been day-dreaming when the (somewhat attractive) manager caught up to me at the register. 

"What can I check you out for?" 

"Don't you think I'm a bit old for you to be checking out?"

The look on her face was nothing compared to the look on mine, once the rest of my brain caught up with what I'd just said.

Fortunately, she's sufficiently familiar with my scatterbrained-ness to press charges.

So begins my weekend.
