"They misunderstand and misuse the concept of âdue process.â Due process is a legal concept, invoked to ensure that the government follows the rule of the Constitution.  Corporations, businesses and the media are not government entities, and due process does not apply. As one legal scholar notes, âThe Constitution doesnât oblige NBC to retain Matt Lauer until a court somewhere finds him guilty of a sex crime.â (C.Emba, The Washington Post, Dec 2017). It is company management that is firing people, for fear of threats to their financial bottom line.  To date, we have seen only one case tried in court, that of the Olympic doctor, Larry Nassar.  Nassar, who was certainly given due process, received a 40-125 year sentence after over one hundred brave young women testified against his abuse. Beyond that, we have not seen mass firings or incarcerations of men for flirting, and nor have we seen mass numbers of men with âruinedâ lives.  Of the famous and celebrity men who have had consequences for their actions, some have lost current jobs, most have lost some reputation, but nearly all will continue to live their lives in the manner to which they are accustomed.   #MeToo has led to a beginning shift in how power dynamics are perceived, and those most upset by this process are those who are realizing that they no longer have carte blanche in their behavior toward employees, patients, students, co-workers, etc." ~Martha Sonnenberg
