"I guess I figure that if God can change the cross so completely, maybe God can change me. Maybe God can change people who run the war machine and every person on the planet who is convinced that the road to security is through the blood of enemies, and that peace can be attained through bullets and bombs, beatings and beheadings." ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
