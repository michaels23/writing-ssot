"It is tragic when religion advances its franchise by turning Genesis 1 into science. It was never about the making of planets and plankton. It was always a metaphor for the human condition, and the ways we find ourselves on battlefields where the darkness claws at us, evil people assault us, predators wait to pounce, and every thought we have, every skill we learn, every hope and dream and imagining we dare to experience can be turned against us, turned into the very chains we are desperate to escape." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
