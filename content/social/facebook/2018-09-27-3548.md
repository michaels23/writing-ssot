"Imagine a politician saying, âI donât remember this incident, but itâs what I was doing at age 17, and I am ashamed. I am trying to do better.â Imagine another saying, âYes, I once preyed on women, and I need to make amends.â Imagine a boss confessing fraud or a worker confessing shirking." ~Tom Ehrich
