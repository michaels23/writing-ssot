"Trump and his right-wing whisperers got us out into the streets protesting an un-American and un-Constitutional ban on Muslim immigrants. While we were enjoying the moment and feeling purposeful, he shoved his top military commander and top intelligence officer off the key security council and installed his ultra-nationalist racist adviser Steve Bannon to a position for which he has no qualifications whatsoever." ~Tom Ehrich
