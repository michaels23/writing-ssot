Perhaps this Thanksgiving it would be helpful to move the conversation beyond our legitimate complaints at all that has gone wrong toward a vision of the world we are FOR. Letâs talk about a new bottom line for our societyâjudging our economy, our corporations, our government policies, our legal and educational institutions as productive, efficient and rational to the extent that they tend to increase love, compassion, generosity, kindness, environmental sanity, ethical behavior, social and economic justice, and enhance our capacity to see others as fundamentally valuable and deserving of respect (rather that see them through a more utilitarian framework of âwhat can they do advance our own personal interests?â) AND how much they increase our capacity to see our mother EARTH not only as something that can be âusedâ to satisfy human needs but also as something that evokes awe, wonder and radical amazement at the grandeur and mystery of life.

~Rabbi Michael Lerner
