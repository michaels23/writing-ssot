"You will want to think carefully about the your ballot in 2018. But you can take action right now. Look at the decisions you make as a consumer that encourage the bad boys running things. They are selling you fantasies and using your loyalty against you. The mega-wealthy are out to skin you. Surely we have learned that by now. They scorn you. Yet they also need you. You are the gravy train. Donât let them use you." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
