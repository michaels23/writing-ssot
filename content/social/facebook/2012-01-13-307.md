"The hierarchy claims that our Catholic tradition does not include womenâs ordination. Wrong. Archaeology reveals that women were ordained priests and bishops in the first centuries of our churchâs existence. 
And more recently, in the 1970s our tradition was moving toward approving ordination for women. This seemed to be the consensus among bishops,theologians, and the 'people of God.' â
