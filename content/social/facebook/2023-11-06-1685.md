"The whole mystery of a cell is that DNA knows what it is doing. Counting billions of genetic base pairs in human DNA gives you a map of the human genome, but it gets nowhere in explaining how DNA, and the living creatures that sprang from it, know how to live. A tiger is fierce, a lamb is gentle. We know this through our three keysâqualia, entanglement, and consciousnessânot through biochemical analysis of their DNA." ~Deepak Chopra
