Each would have their own symbols, educational systems, political and to some extent economic structures, while external security and broader economic and legal systems would be developed and function jointly (with Israel supervising overall security and defense). A permanent negotiation mechanism could adjudicate specific legal, territorial and commercial claims and conflicts as they occur. Most important, a structure of parallel states would allow free movement for people and goods over the whole area, including the right for both peoples to âreturnâ to, live and settle across Israel and the Occupied Territories. In so doing, this arrangement would address presently irresolvable conflicts over Jerusalem, settlements and refugees.
