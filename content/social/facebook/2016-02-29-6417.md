"The imaginary world of Prairie Home Companion wasnât a pipe-dream. It was a world I had glimpsed as a child, a world that actually does exist even to this day. It is a world where people are kind to each other and tolerant of quirks, mistakes and differences. People tease, but in love, and bullies arenât tolerated. Men and women get married and sometimes those marriages lose vitality, and yet they cling to each other and stand together against all adversity." ~ Tom Ehrich
