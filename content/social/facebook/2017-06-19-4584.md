"Jesus encouraged his followers to have courage in a world ruled by liars. The deceitful cannot win, he said. "Nothing" can remain hidden. Moreover, the more you try to hide, the more parched your life becomes. In the end, you are telling lies to bolster lies, you lose touch with what reality even is. That is a life governed by fear of disclosure. All companions become enemies, especially those who know you best." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
