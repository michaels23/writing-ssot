"Later this month, an alarming and potentially devastating era in American life will open. Initial signs of our incoming presidentâs intentions are distressing. Where he means well, I hope we will support him. Where he meals ill, I hope we will resist him. Our first challenge, then, is to seek discernment. Not just knee-jerk disharmony, but discernment of facts on the ground, the meaning of plans being unveiled, and how they will impact real people." ~ Tom Ehrich
