A neighbor slipped on the ice trying to get into her car this morning. She wasn't hurt, but could not get up. There was no way for her to get any leverage. I'm grateful it happened at 9:30 AM. She was alone when she fell, but two of us (eventually three) happened on the scene within minutes. I shudder to think what would have become of her had it been earlier and darker.

I'm also grateful my dog, Tino, is smart enough to have kept out of the way while we humans were helping. At one point, I asked a stranger to hold his leash while I (as the only human > 120 lbs on the scene) gave the victim something to pull herself up with. Tino behaved perfectly. Naturally, once he was sure everything was OK, he befriended everyone enthusiastically.

As a result of all this, I won't be leaving my house again until April 2016. Just in case, though, I did buy another ton of sidewalk salt. The retailers are also grateful.
