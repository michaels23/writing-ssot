... is down to zero cats for the first time in over 25 years. Dave's body gave out (rather peacefully) Thursday night after about 20 years. 

Linda and I computed that, between the two of us, we've had to make 'the decision' over 40 times. It's still hard, but not nearly as soul-wrenching as the very first. Two days later, I still get occasional 'needles' of sadness, but I do get a very small consolation by not scooping out cat boxes on Saturday morning. 

Tino (dog) seems to have adjusted quickly to life with only inanimate toys. :-)
