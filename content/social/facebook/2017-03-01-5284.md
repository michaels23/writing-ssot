"When I attended a majority-black high school in Indianapolis, people who had followed their biases to white-flight suburbs explained that such schools were dangerous, black men would assault white women, and academics would suffer. None of that was true. We were just kids trying to get along. But suburban whites kept saying it, year after year, until the phony came to be viewed as real." ~Tom Ehrich
