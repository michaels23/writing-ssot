I'm thankful for a phone call from my dear friend, Sally Parrish. We've both had a rough year caring for spouse's with cancer. She lost hers (also a dear friend) about a year ago. It's been hard watching her grieve, but I'm glad to go along on the journey.

She called me from their family Thanksgiving, with Susan Parrish Push, Tony Push, Ashley Push, Jacob Push, Terry Watt, Stephen Parrish, Brooke McArthur Parrish, Mark Parrish, and probably others. I'm thankful they're all in my life.
