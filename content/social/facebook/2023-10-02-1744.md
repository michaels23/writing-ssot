"What the modern world settled for is humanism. This is a loaded word in religious societies, but humanism simply means doing without absolutes, in the divine sense, and falling back on the best in human nature. A God who is loving, compassionate, and just, will still be very far away, while a family where the parents are loving, compassionate, and just is very near. Humanism aims to create a spiritual person, not an obedient follower of a religion." ~ Deepak Chopra
