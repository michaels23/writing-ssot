âEveryone will, sooner or later, either in this lifetime or in another, experience a major shift from a focus on âHow much can I have?â to âHow much can I serve?â Moving from a concentration on getting to one of giving is a noble path and is a key to our spiritual growth.

But it is not instinctual for most of us, and it usually requires a set of experiences that form a road to transformation.â
~Ron Scott
