"God reveals that Jesus in fact has no enemies, and allows himself to be killed by the oppressing authority to show that he goes before his people, all people, in eschewing retribution and violence. God validates Jesusâ extraordinary preaching and living by raising him from the dead, the âfirst of many brothers and sisters.â The death and resurrection of Jesus are a witness to his enemies, as well as to his friends, that thereâs a new sheriff in town, and the sheriffâs judgment upon everyone is mercy." ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
