"No battle for the soul of a nation is won easily. But I find myself feeling optimistic. Americaâs weaknesses arenât its only story. We have strengths, as well, such as our Constitution, the rule of law, the common sense of its people, and open minds and open hearts." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
