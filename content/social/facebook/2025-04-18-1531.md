"Christians need to recognize that what the Trump administration is doing to these men is not only unjust, it is evil. Many of these individuals were deported to CECOT without due process and in apparent violation of court orders. In the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was deported due to âan administrative error,â the Trump administration has defied a judgeâs orders to âfacilitateâ Abrego Garciaâs return to the U.S." ~Ryan Duncan
