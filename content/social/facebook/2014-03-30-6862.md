Good news/bad news I: for all my FB friends who have suffered through this brutal winter and live east of MN, the good news is that a warm front is moving your way that has given us 60F today! The bad news is that it arrived so fast that, at least for today, MN is the land of many more than 10,000 lakes.

Added bonus for friends with light-colored dogs like mine: the good news is that Tino has discovered a cheap hair dye for dogs. The bad news is the accompanying ... aroma.
