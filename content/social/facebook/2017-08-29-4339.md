[Another lesson in work-related humility: I spent an evening at a homeless shelter in Winston-Salem, NC. While the homeless slept, I stood watch â and thought myself pretty special. Early in the morning, many of the men put on the cleanest clothes they had and headed out the door. âWhere are they going?â I asked a staffer. âThey are going to work. They have jobs. Those jobs just don't pay enough to afford rent.â] ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
