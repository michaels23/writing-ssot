Like reporters covering the 2016 election, we wanted an easily told drama, with a scorecard and winners vs losers. We didnât see the seething mass of frustrated and angry, whom Clinton dismissed as âdeplorables,â who would eventually hand American democracy to a truly deplorable man. We demonized them, but didnât know them. They were doing the same to their opponents, of course. Democracy cannot survive in mutual demonization grounded in mutual ignorance. ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
