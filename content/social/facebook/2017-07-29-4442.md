Suppose public service was non-professional?  (Define professionalism as the full-time occupation of service for fees or hire.) Employ professionals where they perform *support* services to *implement* decisions. Such services would be well recompensed. But the decision-making would never be paid for, so one couldn't get rich from public service. 

Would a community benefit from such a system? Is it feasible?
