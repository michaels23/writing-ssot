Let's review my past 24 hours:

Yesterday, I got the lawn mowed (Let me emphasize: I finally used a lawnmower, as opposed to a snow-blower.) and planted my seeds *before* it started raining.

This morning, the scattered showers have fallen only while I was driving, not while I was walking to/from the car, so I haven't needed my umbrella.

Another employee entered the building just ahead of me, so I didn't need my badge.  A co-worker entered the 'suite' just ahead of me, so I didn't need my badge. When I got to the coffee machine, a fresh pot of French Roast had just finished.

Net result of all this good fortune: I'm trembling with fear.
