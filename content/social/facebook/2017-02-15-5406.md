"Roman soldiers had a written code of conduct which permitted them to press locals into service to carry their backpacks for them for the distance of a mile. If they went over that distance, they were subject to punishment by their centurion or other officers. So in this case, Jesus suggests "going the extra mile," but it's not to make the oppressor's burden easier. Again, the oppressor is the target of this symbolic action. Now, he has to press for the good nature of the subject, because the bearer has the upper hand. Honor is preserved, no bloodshed." ~@[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
