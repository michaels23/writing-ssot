"If we saw a painting of Jesus as he was, we would see a dark-skinned Jew, not a white European. If we heard him speak, we would hear a radical, not a conservative evangelical or a progressive mainliner. If we saw what he did, we would see him staying clear of the temple cult, standing against the religious establishment, and making his home with the despised, not building a grand facility or whispering in the kingâs ear." ~Tom Ehrich
