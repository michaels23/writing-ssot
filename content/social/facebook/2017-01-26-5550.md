"I think it is time for liberals to stop playing Trumpâs game by his rules. Letâs dial down the facile outrage, stop the nasty social media posts, quit our whining, and realize we are up against a powerful foe. We cannot parade our right-opinion and expect anyone to care. Itâs all about action and dealing with reality." ~Tom Ehrich
