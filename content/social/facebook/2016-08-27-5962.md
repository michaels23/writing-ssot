"The political tensions of 2016 seem to feed on this discouragement â not in seeking solutions for it and realizing they will be expensive, but in deciding whom to blame. Even though it is a total fabrication, the Trump campaign blames people of color and immigrants for the prevailing economic lassitude. The Sanders campaign blamed banks and the 1%. Thus far, the Clinton campaign has been about seeking solutions. Whether that avoidance of blaming can make it to Election Day remains to be seen." ~Tom Ehrich
