"I think we are in such a moment. Godâs reality is staring us in the face. Godâs absolute commitment to the poor and broken is staring us in the face. Godâs fundamental call to self-denial and self-sacrifice is staring us in the face. Godâs honesty, Godâs truth, Godâs mercy, Godâs justice are all staring us in the face." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
