" But it also reveals something about Jesus: he didnât want to have impact. Whether out of humility or situational awareness, he didnât want to gain a following. He had no advance team, no publicity team, no crowd managers, no prayer teams huddling with the freshly converted, no signup teams harvesting names. This wasnât a Billy Graham Crusade. He just came to town, did good, and left." ~Tom Ehrich
