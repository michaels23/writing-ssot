"For Jesus, it was always about caring. Spending time with people, going into their homes, learning the specifics of their lives and caring about them, suffering when they suffered, remembering even the least. Thatâs how he lived, and thatâs how he expected his followers to live." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
