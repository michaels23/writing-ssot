Verse of the day
âWhat good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Surely that faith cannot save, can it? If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food and one of you says to them, âGo in peace; keep warm and eat your fill,â and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that?â
- James 2:14-16

Voice of the day
The most powerful antidote to a world of body terrorism is a world of compassion.
- Sonya Renee Taylor, âThe Body Is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Loveâ (2018)

Prayer of the day
Incarnate God, may we treat every body with compassion. We pray for those of us whose bodies have been terrorized by war, disease, and malnutrition. May we supply each other with our bodily needs.
