I just happened on the paragraph below in a cyber-reprint of the JULY 1973 AA Grapevine. I think the current internet vernacular is "I'm stealing this."

"I had a concept of a creative power, but not a creative beingârather, a supernatural power which had created a universal substance and had brought matter into manifestation. Universal substance, I believed, was the combination of energy and wisdom. Some force had to give direction to energy. Energy is evident in rays, which amalgamate into light and form atoms. Atoms form molecules, and molecules form cells. I further believed the scientific supposition that cells form life. It was not difficult for me to declare that there had to be a source of universal substance. It was that impersonal force which I called "God."
