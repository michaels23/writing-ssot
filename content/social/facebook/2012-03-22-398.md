I was barely a B student in American History, but Trayvon Martin's killing reminds me of the civil rights killings in Philadephia, Mississippi (http://www.usm.edu/crdp/html/cd/neshoba.htm). Will this lead to something like another Civil Rights Act because Florida law seems unable to charge the killer with anything?
