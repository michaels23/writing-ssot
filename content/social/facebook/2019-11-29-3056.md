Yesterday was a rare Thanksgiving where I didn't get into an unpleasant political discussion with anyone. I think that's primarily due to the fact that I was hanging around with loved ones that all think (almost) exactly the way I do. It also helps that I don't have the stamina (stubbornness) that I used to and am beginning to realize that my chances of changing minds (especially my own) are slim and none. If I'm really at the top of my game, though, I remember that I've never met a [insert political label here] that I didn't like. It's the ones I haven't met yet who must be the real @$$#0!=$ .
