This ethic of generosity and sharing didnât start with Jesus. Itâs the heart of the Law, as well, and John the Baptist spoke with clarity to his people. âWhoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none, and whoever has food must do likewise.â No calculation of tax benefits, no turning this over to organized charities. If you have two coats, give one away. Simple as that. ~Tom Ehrich
