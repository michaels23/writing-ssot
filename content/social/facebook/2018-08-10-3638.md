"Godâs love isnât for sale. Godâs eternity is whatever God makes of it. We should live and give without counting the cost or reaching for the prizes. I believe that the God who has loved me throughout my days wonât stop loving me just because death caught up with me. I canât earn Godâs love, and I canât turn it off." ~Tom Ehrich
