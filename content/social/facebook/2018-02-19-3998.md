I pray for this kind of courage:

He said, âthe Son of Man must undergo great sufferingâ â being rejected by the religious establishment, being killed by the political establishment, and being vindicated only by the mighty hand of God, while his disciples hid in fear. And you, he said to them, must do the same.
