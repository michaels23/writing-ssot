Like Germans in 1932, the electorate has voted in the one who would be their oppressor. They voted in the one whose dark side will undo the very pillars of a free economy and, eventually, sink the 25,000 Dow, the recovery from 2008, the tech miracle, and American parity with China. They voted in the one whose moral rot will undo centuries of trust in American values. They voted in a nihilist whose âAmerica firstâ and âme firstâ bullying repulses our allies and emboldens our enemies. And state by state, they voted in his enablers. ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
