Join us in the New Year for meditation! On the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of each month, we meet (for free) on Zoom. Our format is a few minutes of introductions and fellowship, followed by a ~20 guided meditation (usually from Insight Timer).  All are welcome! No experience necessary. Despite the (historical) name of the group, you need not even know where Woodbury is. :-)
