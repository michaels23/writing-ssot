Thus, the statement "Your sins are forgiven" is a revelation of Godâs agape. Rather than being interested in human justice (retribution and expiation), God unilaterally recognizes the human condition and offers love before any request for forgiveness. God puts the âforeâ in âfore-giving.â ~ @[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
