"We occupy a world given to us by others, and while there is great good in us and in those who have passed the world onto us, we are by and large not to be trusted as a race. We're violent, territorial, afraid of change, afraid of those who are different from us. We can't fix that by ourselves. We invent gods who are like us, and we're even capable of inventing a god whom we're able to convince ourselves is God, we do it all the time, but even that god is just a projection of ourselves." @[788560928:2048:Rory Cooney]
