"What religion should be teaching is the immense gap between our purpose in creation and our execution. The wars we wage, the cruelties we accept as normal, the bullying and predatory behavior we allow, the greed we reward -- none of that reveals the "image" and "likeness" of God. They are a perversion of God. They are a declaration of fealty to the darkness, to the serpent representing evil, to the tempter who never ceases to lure us away from the light. Religion should be naming that sinfulness -- relentlessly, boldly, even when it makes us squirm -- and then calling us out of the cave and into the light. " ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
