[If you make people afraid, they will do almost anything. Hence, the one new commandment Jesus gave: âDo not be afraid.â

If you tap the grasping common to us all since childhood, you can lead them to acts of cruelty. Hence, the teachings Jesus gave about dying to self and sharing everything you have with âthe least of these.â ] ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
