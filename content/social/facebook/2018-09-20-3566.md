"The twelve disciples, by contrast, were young and ambitious, even headstrong in some cases. Look at what they did once they received the reins. They argued and jostled for authority, they created a pyramidal structure, they spoke fervently in the public square. In some important ways, the institution they founded reflected their energy and ambition more than it reflected the man who died on a cross." ~Tom Ehrich
