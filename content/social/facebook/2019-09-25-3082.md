This really happened on my morning commute...

Her: Welcome to McDonald's. May I take your order?
Me: 2 Sausage McMuffin with Egg and a large black coffee.
Her: That's 2 #2 meals with coffees?
Me: No, just the 2-for-$2 sandwich deal and a single large black coffee.
Her: $#!T ... &odd@m! ... Someone get him outta here!
Me: Um ... OK ... I guess the meals would be alright ...
Her: #v<K! Somebody! Please help me!
Me: OK. I'll just leave. Hope that helps.
Her: God! Someone get this off me!
Me: (Starting to dial 911).
Her: I'm sorry sir. A squirrel crawled in the window and jumped on my arm. 2 Sausage McMuffin with Egg and a large black coffee will be $4.54. Please pull forward.
