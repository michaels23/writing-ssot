I've been posting gratitude lists for several days. I wonder how honest I've been with them. If Snape slipped three drops of Veritaserum into my morning pumpkin juice, I think my gratitude list would more realistically resemble:

1. My skin is white.
2. I'm heterosexual.
3. My ancestors migrated to this country at least three generations ago.
4. I've convinced people I'm Christian.
5. Identifying as Catholic no longer seems to be a disqualifying offense. 
6. (Summarizing 1-5: I'm not a target.)

7. I'm male.
8. I got my degrees before the student loan crisis.
9. My skills are marketable way above the poverty level.
10. The crash of 2008 only put a moderate dent in my net worth.

Maybe I should call this my 'whew' list?
