On today's episode of Mike has a Powerful Brain ... When he Remembers to Use it:

It is only now that I'm putting the groceries away that I realize (yet again) that what I thought was a head of lettuce ... is actually a head of cabbage. I can't even blame the grocer. The vegetables were reasonably separated.

On the plus side, this phenomenon has helped me find some tasty coleslaw recipes.
