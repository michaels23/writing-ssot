"Look at what Jesus did. A Canaanite woman approached him. That was an affront, for she was Gentile and female. But Jesus engaged with her. He spoke, she spoke, he listened, she responded. She begged, he hid behind tribal custom. But they kept at it. Eventually Jesus heard the truth within her words, and he changed his mind." ~@[606922327:2048:Tom Ehrich]
