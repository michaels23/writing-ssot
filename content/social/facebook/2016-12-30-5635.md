"Add to that seasonal downdraft a new element this year, namely, escalating worries about the days ahead in politics and in all corners of American life. A new normal is descending on us. Many relish the thought of it. I think we need to see their delight and not dismiss them as haters. Many others feel a deep sense of dread. Something profound and fundamental in the American experience is being lost. This dread deserves respect, too, by people on all sides." ~ Tom Ehrich
