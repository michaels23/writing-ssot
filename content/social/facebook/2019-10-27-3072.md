This is why it takes me 10+ minutes longer to get home from church than it used to: I now have a post-church agenda...
1) Wonder where the hell I parked this week. (2 min.)
2) Wonder which car I'm driving today (the first-world problem of owning two cars). (1 min.)
3) Remember that there might be more than one white Prius in a 500-car lot. (1 min.)
4) Apologize to the bewildered owner of the other white Prius that I appeared to be stealing. (1 min.)
5) Thank her for not having me committed.(1 min.)
6) Mutter (under breath) "It will happen to you too, someday," as I hunt for another white Prius. (1 min.)
7) Occasionally repeat 3-6.
8) Thank God I found MY white Prius (or at least one that my key will open).
9) Thank God I still remember where I live.
10) Drive there.
