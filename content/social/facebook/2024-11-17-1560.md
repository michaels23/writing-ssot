"This week Iâve been re-reading and reflecting on Hebrews, particularly Hebrews 11, where the author writes: âNow faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not seeâ and shares the testimony of what a great cloud of witnesses from throughout the Bible were able to withstand and overcome by faith. The author goes on to say: âTherefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faithâ (Hebrews 12:1-2).
