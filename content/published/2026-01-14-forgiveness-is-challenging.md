I want to forgive Jonathan Ross. I want to forgive Kristi Noem. I want to forgive Donald Trump. I want to forgive Benjamin Netanyahu. I want to forgive Vladimir Putin.  I want to forgive Nicolás Maduro. I have a longer list. It’s quite a challenge. 

I aspire to “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” I want to be Christian, not just in name only. I want to obey the two great commandments of Jesus of Nazareth. I want to love my neighbor as myself. The names I’ve mentioned are all my neighbors. It is difficult to love them. 

I want to forgive them. I’m not there yet. So, I pray for the willingness to let God remove all of the things to which I still cling.
