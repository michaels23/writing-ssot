Despite my passion for automation, artificial intelligence (AI) felt a little spooky to me at first. I worried it would get out of control. Over the past year or so, though, I couldn’t resist. What I found wasn’t a world-ending machine, but a versatile tool. Many of us are familiar with the [Infinite Monkey Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem). I now think of AI as a vast number of computers using a vast number of search engines (and other tools) to _seem_ like human intelligence. I no longer worry AI will ‘think for itself.’ I am concerned about the environmental impacts of all those data centers, though. So, I take a conservationist approach to AI.

I went from being “nervous about AI” to “gaining a lot from it.” I want to show others how to do the same. This is a beginner-friendly guide to turning AI—specifically **Google Gemini**—into a personal assistant.

## Why Google Gemini?

There are many AI tools out there. I started with [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) because I already use Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Maps. Gemini can “talk” to those apps to actually get things done for me. It’s not just a chatbot; it’s an extension of the tools I already use every day. In fact, I asked Gemini to write the first draft of the post you’re reading:

“I want to write a WordPress blog post. that explains how to use artificial intelligence to a number of my friends. I really gain a lot from it. But I’m not afraid of it like I used to be. At first I thought it was too spooky and was going to take over the world. Now that I’ve used my technical background to my advantage to really learn how to use it , I feel like I could explain it to a lot of friends with a good blog post. I’d like to be able to write something that gives a newcomer a how-to get started using things like Google Gemini to automate simple tasks.”

## 3 Simple Tasks You Can Automate Today

You don’t need to be a “techie” to start saving hours of time. Here are three “low-hanging fruit” tasks to try right now:

### 1\. The “Inbox Decoder” (Summarizing Emails)

We all have those long, rambling email chains. Instead of reading through 20 replies to find the conclusion, ask Gemini:

> _“@Gmail find the latest emails from my landlord and summarize what I need to do by Friday.”_

**The Result:** It scans your mail and gives you a bulleted list of action items. No more digging.

### 2\. The “Instant Itinerary” (Travel Planning)

Planning a trip is usually a headache of tabs and spreadsheets. Try this:

> _“I’m going to Chicago for a weekend in April. Use @Google Maps to find three highly-rated hotels near Millennium Park and suggest a 2-day walking itinerary.”_

**The Result:** You get a full schedule and a map layout in seconds.

### 3\. The “Video SparkNotes” (YouTube Summaries)

Don’t have 30 minutes to watch a tutorial? Give Gemini the link:

> _“Summarize the key takeaways from this YouTube video \[Link\] and tell me the exact timestamp where they talk about \[Topic\].”_

## The Secret Sauce: How to Talk to AI

The biggest hurdle for newcomers is often knowing what to say. If you treat it like a search engine (using just keywords), you’ll get mediocre results. Instead, treat it like a **smart intern**.

*   **Give it a Role:** “Act as a professional travel agent…” or “Act as a strict editor…”
*   **Give it Context:** Instead of “Write an email,” try “Write a polite but firm email to my neighbor asking them to move their car.”
*   **Ask for a Format:** “Give me the answer in a bulleted list” or “Put this into a table.”

## I Fear Change – at First

The “spookiness” of AI came from the unknown (and my active imagination). Once I started using it to automate the boring parts of life—like drafting emails or organizing grocery lists — I realized it does give me _more_ time for the things that actually matter.

### What’s the first step?

Go to gemini.google.com, sign in with your Google account, and ask it something like:

“Suggest 5 easy dinner recipes based on the ingredients I have: chicken, spinach, and pasta.”
