I’m starting to wonder if I really want ICE out of Minnesota. My ego certainly does. My body certainly does. What’s left of my rational mind asks inconvenient questions like “How is that different from making ICE someone else’s problem?” and “How is that different from telling a bully to go pick on someone else?”
