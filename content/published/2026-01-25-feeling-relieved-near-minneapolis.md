According to my Sleep Number app, I got 7h 40m restful sleep last night. That far exceeded my meager expectations.

When I went to bed, my imagination was working overtime. I expected to hear first responders all night. I would not have been surprised to hear civil defense sirens. I would not have been surprised to hear explosions.

When I woke, I postponed my usual prayer routine (unless you count “Please, no violence. Please, no violence. Please, no violence. “). I try not to touch my phone for the first 30 minutes of the day. Today, I was compelled.

From what I can tell, there was no violence overnight. I hope that’s the case. I admire everyone who stood up against injustice without perpetuating the cycle of revenge.

I don’t care to be \*labeled\* Minnesotan. I don’t care to be \*labeled\* American. I do care to \*be\* human.

I don’t care to be \*labeled\* Christian. I do care to \*be\* Christian (and, to paraphrase Gandhi, “… and a Muslim … and a Hindu … and a Jew … “)

When I’m not over-complicating things, I get clarity from Jesus’ two commandments:

1\. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.

2\. Love your neighbor as yourself.

It’s been a while since I’ve read the Quran, the Vedas, or the Torah, but I think I read something similar in each of those.

Simple, but not easy.
