I’m not sure I want Kristi Noem to step down. I worry that would _delay_ ICE reform. 

Most of America already knows Kristi Noem is dishonest and supports cruel and unusual punishment. I think most of America also believes Kristi Noem’s replacement would _also_ be dishonest and support cruel and unusual punishment. (The bettor in me would go ‘all in’ on that.) Despite that skepticism, I hope I would be among those that give Kristi Noem’s replacement the benefit of the doubt (innocent until proven guilty). I worry that would delay ICE reform. 

I do want Kristi Noem impeached. The impeachment trial has the best chance of exposing the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I think it’s important for America to have as much information as possible.

I doubt Mike Johnson will allow a _vote_ on any articles of impeachment, but I want America to hear those articles. He can’t prevent that. That’s also why I think Kristi Noem will step down before those come out.
