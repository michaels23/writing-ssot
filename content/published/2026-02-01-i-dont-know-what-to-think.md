I’m starting to use ‘Homo Sapiens’ as shorthand for statements like “I don’t know what to think.” It’s a huge part of the human condition. (I occasionally envy animals their simpler instincts.) To me, the only time it doesn’t apply is when I consider the moment I _currently_ experience.

When I consider the past, it’s frequently with regret. I don’t know what to think about what did happen.

When I consider the future, it’s frequently with anxiety. I don’t know what to think about what might happen.

When I consider the _current_ moment, I usually _do_ know what to think. Depending on which vernacular this brain dials up, the question translates to, e.g., “What’s the next right thing for me to do?” On the rare occasions when this brain slows down enough to consider that, I usually know what to think.
